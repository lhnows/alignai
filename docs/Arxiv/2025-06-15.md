### [2] [LoRA-Edit: Controllable First-Frame-Guided Video Editing via Mask-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10082)
*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的LoRA调优方法，用于灵活的视频编辑，无需改变模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法依赖大规模预训练，缺乏灵活性，尤其是对后续帧的控制不足。

Method: 采用掩码驱动的LoRA调优策略，结合输入视频和参考图像，动态调整模型注意力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频编辑性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效且灵活的视频编辑，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [DeepTraverse: A Depth-First Search Inspired Network for Algorithmic Visual Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10084)
*Bin Guo,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse是一种新型视觉架构，受算法搜索策略启发，通过系统阐明和自适应细化学习特征，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉主干网络特征构建方式单一，缺乏自适应迭代细化路径，能否通过算法搜索原则实现更结构化、逻辑化的处理流程？

Method: DeepTraverse包含递归探索模块（深化特征分析）和自适应校准模块（动态调整特征显著性），通过算法交互智能构建特征。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，DeepTraverse表现出色，分类准确率和特征区分度优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 集成算法先验为构建更高效、性能更强且结构化的视觉主干提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over
temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single

embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

### [5] [EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100)
*Yantai Yang,Yuhao Wang,Zichen Wen,Luo Zhongwei,Chang Zou,Zhipeng Zhang,Chuan Wen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA是一种无需训练的高效推理加速框架，通过系统性消除冗余，显著提升Vision-Language-Action模型的推理速度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型因计算和内存冗余严重，限制了实际部署能力，亟需一种全面解决方案。

Method: 结合三种策略：语言模块层剪枝、视觉任务感知优化和扩散动作头特征缓存。

Result: 在CogACT模型上实现1.93倍加速，FLOPs降至28.9%，性能仅下降0.6%。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA为VLA模型提供了一种高效、低损失的推理加速方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

### [6] [A Manually Annotated Image-Caption Dataset for Detecting Children in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10117)
*Klim Kireev,Ana-Maria Creţu,Raphael Meier,Sarah Adel Bargal,Elissa Redmiles,Carmela Troncoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD)，一个用于检测未成年人图像的多模态数据集，填补了现有空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏用于多模态环境中检测未成年人内容的基准数据集，阻碍了相关工具的开发与评估。

Method: 发布了包含10,000张图像-标题对的ICCWD数据集，并手动标注了是否包含未成年人。使用该数据集评估了三种检测方法。

Result: 最佳检测方法的真阳性率为75.3%，表明未成年人检测任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ICCWD的发布有望促进更优的未成年人检测方法的设计，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high
predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with
smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most
efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article
reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA为跨域端到端自动驾驶提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

### [10] [SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10173)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真图像时表现优异，但在提示引导下生成多样化样本仍具挑战性，尤其是需要跨语义相似提示评估多样性时。

Result: 实验表明，SPARKE在多个文本到图像扩散模型中显著提升了生成数据的提示感知多样性，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效解决了提示感知多样性引导的计算问题，为大规模生成任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [11] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力机制的模拟器，用于从卫星图像序列中学习晴空地表反射率，解决了传统方法在山区因雪盖变化导致的背景反射率估计不准确的问题。


<details>

Result: 模型在提供足够长的时间上下文时，性能与基于反照率的模型相当，尤其在山区表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法能隐式学习地表反射率动态，提升复杂地形下的泛化能力，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/frischwood/HeMu-dev.git

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效探测方法（EP），通过多查询交叉注意力机制优化了注意力探测的性能和效率，显著提升了速度和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分反映掩码图像建模（MIM）的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数冗余和计算效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的探测方法。

Method: 提出高效探测（EP），采用多查询交叉注意力机制，减少冗余投影和可训练参数，提升计算效率。

Result: EP在七个基准测试中优于LP和现有注意力探测方法，泛化能力强，生成可解释的注意力图，并在低样本和分层设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EP是一种高效且通用的探测方法，显著提升了注意力探测的性能和效率。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于个性化视觉语言检索的方法，通过调整双编码器模型的内部表示，结合正则化低秩适应和参数加法策略，显著提升了新概念的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化视觉语言检索需要从少量示例中学习新概念，并整合个人与通用知识以识别不同上下文中的概念。

Method: 采用正则化低秩适应调整语言编码器最后一层的少量参数，结合参数加法策略整合多个学习到的个人概念。

Result: 在两个基准测试（DeepFashion2和ConCon-Chi）上，个性化检索准确率比现有方法提高了4%-22%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留通用知识的同时，有效提升了新概念的识别能力，为个性化视觉语言检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Motivation: 解决标记数据有限时判别器性能不足的问题。

Method: 通过扩散采样中不同类条件轨迹的分数凸组合生成挑战性合成样本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升判别能力，且发现组合判别器嵌入空间中距离较远的类效果更好。

Conclusion: ScoreMix无需大量参数搜索即可显著提升性能，适用于数据收集困难的实际场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at
our GitHub repository.

*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySS提出了一种基于状态空间学习和动态查询的3D物体检测方法，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集BEV特征或大量查询，计算成本高，难以扩展到多帧视频。

Method: DySS利用状态空间模型（SSM）处理时序特征，引入未来预测和掩码重建辅助任务，动态更新查询。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上，DySS达到65.31 NDS和57.4 mAP，优于现有方法；实时推理速度为33 FPS。

Conclusion: DySS通过状态空间学习和动态查询，实现了高效且高性能的3D物体检测。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前幻觉检测方法计算成本高且无法处理真实场景中的模糊边界，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 构建包含15万标注样本的HalLoc数据集，并开发低开销的基线模型，支持实时检测。

Result: HalLoc数据集和基线模型实现了高效幻觉检测，可无缝集成现有视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: HalLoc为提升视觉语言模型的可信度提供了新途径，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确诊断对早期治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识。

Method: 使用迁移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）方法，在HAM10000数据集上评估多种预训练特征提取器和分类器，并引入UQ技术（如MCD和集成方法）。

Result: CLIP-based视觉变换器（如LAION CLIP ViT-H/14与SVM结合）表现最佳；集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间表现良好。

Conclusion: 将UQ整合到基于深度学习的医疗诊断中，可提升性能和临床应用的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，每年医疗支出超过80亿美元。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致医生疲劳，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病灶图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且临床实用，显著减轻医生负担，同时减少对大规模标注数据的需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分析学生学术情绪中的潜力，发现Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法难以泛化，而VLMs通过零样本提示提供了一种无需微调的新方法。

Method: 使用两种VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）对5000张学生面部表情图像进行零样本分析。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现更优，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪上，但无法检测分心行为。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct可用于识别学生困惑情绪。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点特征感知的高斯溅射框架，解决了3DGS在稀疏视图输入下过拟合的问题，实现了实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 利用立体基础模型估计相机姿态和稠密点云，通过多尺度2D特征采样和自注意力机制增强点间交互，最终用MLP解码高斯参数。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，在少样本设置下与最先进的3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图下实现了高质量的实时渲染，解决了3DGS的过拟合问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时满足遵循文本指令和聚焦局部部分的需求，GeoCAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出互补标注策略（顶点和VLLM标注），训练时随机掩码局部部分并利用LLM预测，推理时用户可指定局部修改。

Result: 实验表明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD为局部几何可控的CAD生成提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

Method: 采用视觉语言模型构建多模态框架UrbanSense，定量生成和比较城市风格表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，超过80%的描述通过t检验（p<0.05），主观评估的高Phi分数（城市0.912，时期0.833）验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能科学量化城市风格演变，为未来设计提供数据支持。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的配准方法需将图像重采样至固定分辨率，这会引入插值伪影，而医学图像常因采集参数不同而分辨率各异。

Method: RKM 扩展了 KeyMorph 框架，通过训练网络学习图像对的关键点，并在真实世界坐标系中输出关键点，利用扫描仪的仿射矩阵实现分辨率无关性。

Result: 实验表明，RKM 在腹部 MRI 正交 2D 堆栈和不同分辨率脑部 3D 数据集的配准任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: RKM 提供了一种无需重采样的高效配准方案，适用于多分辨率医学图像。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法在语义对齐和运动合成方面虽有进展，但依赖端到端映射策略，难以捕捉深层语言结构和逻辑推理，导致生成的运动缺乏可控性和多样性。

Method: 提出Motion-R1框架，集成Chain-of-Thought机制，将复杂指令分解为逻辑动作路径，并采用Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习算法联合优化推理链和运动合成。

Conclusion: Motion-R1通过显式推理和联合优化，显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Result: 实验表明FSATFusion在融合质量和效率上优于其他方法，且具备优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FSATFusion在红外与可见光图像融合及下游视觉任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 自注意力机制虽成功但缺乏理论解释，现有框架对其组件的机理理解不足。

Result: 实验表明，基于图像处理的修改不仅提升了可解释性，还提高了任务准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为自注意力机制提供了更深入的理论基础，并展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底人为物体的埋藏状态对研究局部沉积动力学、评估生态风险、污染物迁移以及危险材料（如弹药）的回收或缓解策略至关重要。

Method: 通过结合CAD模型与观测图像对齐，并拟合海底局部平面近似，推断埋藏深度。方法在54个物体（包括桶和弹药）的ROV视频中验证。

Result: 模型平均埋藏深度误差约为10厘米，并能解析反映沉积物迁移过程的空间埋藏模式。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了海底埋藏的非侵入式、可扩展测绘，支持污染场地的环境评估。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态自适应区域标记器（DART），通过自适应划分图像为不同大小的内容相关补丁，解决了固定大小补丁在背景区域过度编码和局部细节丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非卷积模型（如ViT和Vim）依赖固定大小补丁，导致背景区域过度编码和关键局部细节丢失，尤其在信息稀疏分布时。

Method: DART结合可学习区域评分和分段可微分分位数操作，自适应分配更密集的标记到信息丰富区域。

Result: DART仅增加约1M参数，在DeiT（ImageNet-1K）上准确率提升2.1%，同时减少45% FLOPs。

Conclusion: DART在DeiT、Vim和VideoMamba上一致提升性能，计算开销极小甚至减少，是一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出ReconMOST，一种基于数据驱动的扩散模型框架，用于多层海水温度重建，解决了传统方法在稀疏数据和高计算成本下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的海洋重建对全球气候动力学和海洋气象研究至关重要，但传统方法因数据稀疏和计算成本高而受限，机器学习方法也仅适用于表层或局部区域。

Method: 提出ReconMOST框架，先通过历史数值模拟数据预训练无条件扩散模型，再以稀疏高精度观测数据为引导点进行反向扩散，实现多层温度重建。

Result: 在缺失数据超过92.5%的情况下，仍保持高精度重建，MSE值在引导、重建和总体上分别为0.049、0.680和0.633。

Conclusion: ReconMOST扩展了机器学习在海洋温度重建中的应用，具有高精度、高分辨率和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: Pisces是一个多模态基础模型，通过解耦视觉编码架构和定制训练技术，在图像理解和生成任务中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一模型在图像理解和生成任务中表现不佳，主要因视觉特征和训练过程的差异。

Method: 采用解耦视觉编码架构和定制训练技术，结合数据筛选、预训练和微调。

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准和GenEval生成基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成的协同关系，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景下因低信噪比、目标形态多样及缺乏视觉线索而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法因目标内在变异性及弱先验导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出LRRNet框架，采用压缩-重建-减法（CRS）范式，直接学习图像域中的低秩背景结构，无需显式矩阵分解。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，LRRNet在检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率方面优于38种先进方法，实时性能达82.34 FPS，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: LRRNet首次通过端到端深度学习直接建模低秩背景结构，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态视频摘要方法难以捕捉视频的完整语义丰富性，因此需要多模态方法。

Method: MF2Summ采用五阶段流程：特征提取、跨模态注意力交互、特征融合、片段预测和关键镜头选择，使用Transformer建模模态依赖和时间对应关系。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上，MF2Summ的F1分数分别比DSNet模型提高了1.9%和0.6%，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合显著提升了视频摘要的性能，证明了多模态方法的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CIDer是一个新型的多模态情感识别框架，通过自蒸馏和因果推理模块解决模态缺失和分布外数据问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态缺失和分布外（OOD）数据的双重挑战，现有方法实用性受限。

Method: 提出CIDer框架，包含自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和因果推理模块（MACI），并引入RMFM任务。MSSD通过权重共享提升鲁棒性，MACI通过因果图减少偏差。

Result: CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景中表现优异，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer为MER提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式运动引导方法在人体视频压缩中因复杂多样的运动模式导致重建结果失真和运动不准确，因此需要探索更有效的方法。

Method: 通过将复杂人体信号表征为紧凑视觉特征，并将其转换为隐式运动引导以重建信号。

Result: 实验证明IMT范式能有效提升GHVC的压缩效率和重建保真度。

Conclusion: 隐式运动变换（IMT）为生成式人体视频编码提供了高效且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）因其高维和丰富的光谱信息与自然图像不同，现有对抗攻击方法在HSI上研究有限且难以充分利用图像结构信息。

Method: 方法包括分块处理（保持图像结构不变，随机分块并应用变换）和设计特征距离损失（以中间层特征距离为主损失，输出层预测为辅损失）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公开HSI数据集上生成的对抗样本对黑盒模型具有有效可迁移性，且在防御策略下仍保持强攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分块和特征距离损失设计，显著提升了对抗样本的可迁移性和攻击效果。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Motivation: 量化是降低DNN推理成本的重要工具，但现有研究很少关注权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 通过分析不同权重初始化对CNN量化鲁棒性的影响，提出GHN-QAT方法，利用GHN预测量化DNN参数并微调。

Result: GHN-QAT显著提升了4-bit量化的精度，并在2-bit量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music

textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合持续反向传播（CB）算法，提出了一种改进类增量学习（CIL）性能的新技术，用于蜂蜜植物来源分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜的植物来源影响其风味和健康价值，但一次性收集所有蜂蜜品种训练模型不现实，因此需要类增量学习技术。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的隐藏神经元来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提高了1-7%。

Conclusion: CB算法有效解决了类增量学习中的可塑性损失问题，提升了蜂蜜植物来源分类的准确性。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSLG-SAM框架通过两阶段分解RRSIS任务，结合视觉定位网络和增强的SAM模型，显著减少标注负担并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RRSIS方法对密集标注的依赖和复杂场景解释的挑战。

Method: 分为粗定位和精细分割两阶段：视觉定位网络粗略定位目标，SAM模型在坐标引导下进行精确分割。

Result: 在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M数据集上性能显著提升，超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM有效减少标注需求并提升分割精度，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: J-DDL显著提升了自动化飞机检测技术，并公开了首个飞机损伤数据集。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Conclusion: CogStream任务和CogReasoner模型为流媒体视频推理提供了新的解决方案，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Result: 实验证明CEI在检测细微偏差方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CEI为评估人脸识别系统的公平性提供了敏感且鲁棒的工具，适用于任何需要分析分布尾部的统计问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and

decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

<details>

Motivation: 音乐与舞蹈之间存在语义鸿沟，音乐仅提供抽象线索，而舞蹈动作需要更明确的指导。此外，单一音乐可对应多种舞蹈动作，数据稀缺也限制了模型学习。

Method: DanceChat包含三个模块：LLM生成伪指令、多模态特征提取与融合、基于扩散的运动合成与对齐损失。

Result: 在AIST++数据集和人工评估中，DanceChat在质量和多样性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DanceChat通过LLM的显式指导，实现了更高质量和多样性的音乐到舞蹈生成。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Method: 利用文本生成图像模型生成多样化图像，结合类热图和可学习原型，同时采用提示调优和适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升3.47%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL无需全语义标注，减少人工工作量，且兼容现有CLIP框架，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff在多个数据集上验证了其有效性，能更好地保留超球面流形结构。

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Result: 在mini-ImageNet数据集上，该方法生成了更鲁棒和细粒度的注意力图，提升了性能。

Conclusion: 不对称随机掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，能增强模型表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: HEA-MM框架能有效评估飞机CAD模型的误差，满足高质量制造需求。

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

TL;DR: SSP框架通过语义解耦的空间分区，解决了高密度场景中定向目标检测的样本分配和实例混淆问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高密度场景中定向目标检测的标注成本高，现有方法因规则设计僵硬导致样本分配不足和实例混淆。

Method: SSP结合规则驱动的先验注入和数据驱动的标签净化，提出像素级和语义级的空间分区方法。

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0等数据集上，SSP的mAP达45.78%，优于PointOBB-v2 4.10%，与ORCNN和ReDet结合后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: SSP为高密度场景的定向目标检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

TL;DR: LatentCSI利用预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）从WiFi CSI测量生成环境图像，避免了传统方法的复杂计算，并通过文本引导实现高效高质量的图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖复杂的GANs技术，计算量大且效率低，LatentCSI旨在通过轻量级网络和LDM简化流程并提升质量。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络将CSI振幅直接映射到LDM的潜在空间，结合文本引导的扩散模型和预训练解码器生成高分辨率图像。

Result: 在公开数据集和自采数据集上验证，LatentCSI在计算效率和感知质量上优于基线方法，并支持文本引导控制。

Conclusion: LatentCSI提供了一种高效、高质量且可控的图像生成方法，适用于WiFi CSI到图像的转换。

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

TL;DR: MSTAR是一种无需边界框标注的场景文本检索方法，通过动态捕获多粒度文本表示和统一自由文本查询，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的边界框标注且难以统一多样化的查询需求。

Conclusion: MSTAR在减少标注成本的同时显著提升了多查询场景文本检索能力。

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到纹理合成方法因扩散过程中对先前合成纹理信息整合不足以及预定义相机位置选择不合理，导致纹理一致性差。

Method: TexTailor通过重采样方案整合先前合成纹理信息，并微调深度感知扩散模型，同时提出性能保持损失和自适应相机位置调整。

Result: 在Objaverse和ShapeNet汽车数据集上的实验表明，TexTailor在合成视角一致纹理方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理信息整合和相机位置选择，显著提升了纹理合成的视角一致性。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域缺乏文本到图像的潜在扩散模型研究，主要由于数据隐私问题导致数据有限。标准模型未能有效对齐临床文本与影像信息。

Method: 提出了一种微调框架，改进预训练模型的多模态对齐能力，使其适用于下游任务（如短语定位）。

Result: 在标准数据集（MS-CXR）上达到最优性能，并在外部数据（VinDr-CXR）上表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像领域的文本到图像生成任务提供了高效解决方案，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

Method: 采用对称学习目标联合建模正向和反向转换，引入新训练目标显式保留语义信息，支持一步分割和分类。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别达到FID 11.9和7.0，仅需25步推理，同时在分割和分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SymmFlow在多任务中实现了高效且一致的性能，为生成模型和语义任务提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

Motivation: 挑战当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在长视频理解（LVU）任务中的局限性，提出一种无需扩展上下文窗口或强视觉感知能力的替代方案。

Method: 结合文本大型推理模型（LRM）和模块化多模态工具包（包括多模态检索器和视觉感知器），通过推理制定问题解决策略，并选择性访问视频内容。

Result: 在MLVU、Video-MME和LVBench等基准测试中，性能分别提升9.6%、6.6%和3.9%，超越现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决长视频理解任务中的关键挑战方面具有潜力，无需依赖复杂的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，GigaVideo-1在17个维度上平均提升4%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1无需人工标注和大量真实数据，展示了高效和有效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 直接从视频中学习上下文图像编辑是可行的，且模型在多任务和多轮编辑中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Motivation: 解决现有原型方法在医学图像中可视化不一致和原型过于细粒度的问题。

Method: 利用ViT捕捉长距离依赖，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，学习可解释的病灶原型。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分类中表现优异，原型具有临床相关性。

Conclusion: PiPViT能透明解释决策，辅助临床诊断。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Conclusion: MMMG基准揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason为未来研究提供了开放基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、低成本的Deepfake检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案在深度学习快速发展下易受攻击，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原始图像特征，导致失真且适用性受限。

Method: UAC利用大型语言模型（LLM）增强CAPTCHA多样性，支持定向和非定向攻击。针对定向攻击，使用EDICT方法优化扩散模型的双潜变量；针对非定向攻击，提出BP-UAC策略，采用多模态梯度和双路径优化。

Result: 实验表明BP-UAC在多种系统中攻击成功率高，生成的CAPTCHA对人类和DNN均难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效提升了对抗攻击的适用性和隐蔽性，为CAPTCHA安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用（如机器人和自动驾驶）需要模型同时处理实例和类别的持续学习，但目前的研究仅关注单一层面。

Method: 提出HyperCLIC算法，利用双曲空间建模层次关系，结合双曲分类和蒸馏目标。

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异，提升了层次泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC通过双曲空间有效建模层次关系，为复杂现实场景中的持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法在目标与背景视觉差异较小的情况下表现有限，尤其是后处理细化方面尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出UMBD框架，结合不确定性引导的掩蔽机制和伯努利扩散，并设计HUQNet网络以多分支架构融合多源不确定性。

Result: 在多个COD基准测试中，UMBD显著提升了性能，平均MAE提升5.5%，加权F-measure提升3.2%。

Conclusion: UMBD框架能够无缝集成现有COD模型，结合判别与生成优势，为COD任务提供了有效的后处理解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Motivation: InP晶圆制造中，由于生产规模小和设计变异性高，缺乏黄金标准模板，导致缺陷检测依赖手动且效率低下。

Method: 使用深度神经网络从CAD数据生成逼真的InP晶圆图像，作为合成黄金标准，并评估不同训练目标的效果。

Result: 深度学习方法优于基于决策树的基线方法，能够从CAD计划生成模拟黄金标准，提高缺陷检测效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在表面缺陷检测中具有实际应用价值，可通过模板匹配提升检测效率。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Result: 在六个医学数据集上，IQE-CLIP在零样本和少样本设置中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP通过多模态信息融合，有效解决了医学异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

Motivation: 传统任意尺度图像超分辨率方法在超出训练范围时性能显著下降，导致模糊问题。

Method: 通过笔划向量放大器将图像分解为矢量图形进行放大，结合细节补全模块恢复缺失细节，采用循环策略迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，SbCA在超大规模上采样任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法，生成高质量超分辨率图像。

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影和模糊，为超大规模图像超分辨率提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计的提示和分数传播，预训练多模态模型已为通用文本查询视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种模型无关、无需调参的方法，可无缝集成到现有配准框架中，显著提升了无监督配准的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Conclusion: HOMAE通过结合全局上下文和局部几何，有效解决了遮挡问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for

pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to

Motivation: 当前AI工具在图形设计中难以准确整合用户资产、保持可编辑性和专业视觉效果，而商业系统依赖模板库，难以复制。

Method: 使用协议模型生成JSON规范，详细描述每层布局、内容和样式，再通过条件背景模型合成背景。

Result: CreatiPoster在图形设计生成方面超越领先的开源和商业系统，并发布了一个10万多层设计的版权免费语料库。

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动了AI辅助图形设计的民主化，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种零样本生成模型适应方法（ZSGM），通过分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本偏移与图像偏移的不对齐问题，并提出了一种迭代优化方法（AIR）来提升生成图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设文本偏移与图像偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在分析这种不对齐现象并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐问题，并提出Adaptation with Iterative Refinement（AIR）方法，迭代优化生成图像质量。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性、定量和用户研究中均表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 偏移不对齐与概念距离相关，AIR方法通过迭代优化显著提升了零样本生成模型的适应能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

TL;DR: M4V是一个基于Mamba架构的多模态文本到视频生成框架，通过多模态扩散Mamba块和奖励学习策略，显著降低了计算成本并提升了视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在视频生成中计算复杂度高的问题，同时提升多模态和时空建模的效率。

Method: 提出多模态扩散Mamba块（MM-DiM），结合多模态令牌重组设计和奖励学习策略。

Result: M4V在768×1280分辨率下比基于注意力的方法减少45%的FLOPs，同时生成高质量视频。

Conclusion: M4V在降低计算成本的同时，有效提升了文本到视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉生成方法使用空间块构建视觉序列，与自回归的因果性本质矛盾，因此提出从频谱视角实现序列因果性。

Method: 1. 使用嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记；2. 以从粗到细的方式自回归生成频谱标记序列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，SpectralAR仅用64个标记和310M参数即达到3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果性和高效性，为自回归视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

TL;DR: CDPruner是一种新型视觉令牌修剪方法，通过最大化条件多样性来优化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs中视觉令牌冗余导致的高推理成本问题，现有方法因依赖注意力或相似性修剪而性能不佳。

Method: 提出基于条件多样性的修剪方法CDPruner，利用DPP最大化保留令牌的条件多样性。

Result: 在多种MLLMs上实现SOTA性能，显著降低FLOPs（95%）和CUDA延迟（78%），同时保持94%的原始准确率。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性优化令牌选择，高效降低计算成本且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Conclusion: 超二次曲面基元能高效建模复杂结构，QuadricFormer为3D占用预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Result: 实验验证了方法在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1上的优越性能，实现了生成质量和视觉属性的精细控制。

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中进行了头级注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性，并提供了有效的扰动策略设计。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于实时3D场景修复。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Result: 方法在多样数据集上展示了更高的视觉一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了更优的新视角合成效果。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和从2D扩展到3D时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度不足、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，引入损失函数确保密度均匀性和几何规则性，并采用分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在多种密度分布下表现出优于传统方法的密度均衡性和双射性，且能无缝扩展到3D领域。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的实用化提供了可扩展且鲁棒的新方法。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

TL;DR: FastFLUX是一种架构级剪枝框架，通过BRLL方法和ST训练策略，显著提升FLUX模型的推理效率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I生成模型（如FLUX）参数庞大，推理慢且部署困难，现有加速方法性能下降明显且训练成本高。

Method: 提出BRLL方法，用轻量线性层替换复杂残差分支，并引入ST训练策略，通过LoRA监督邻近块以减少性能损失。

Result: FastFLUX在剪枝20%的情况下仍保持高质量图像生成，推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: FastFLUX有效解决了FLUX模型的效率问题，为T2I生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Classifier-free guidance (CFG)需要特定训练且仅适用于条件生成，限制了其广泛应用。TPG旨在克服这些限制。

Method: TPG通过规范保持的随机操作直接扰动扩散网络中的中间令牌表示，提供稳定且有效的引导信号。

Result: 实验表明，TPG在无条件生成中显著提升FID指标（接近2倍改进），同时在条件生成中与CFG表现相当。

Conclusion: TPG是一种通用且无需训练的引导方法，能够为更广泛的扩散模型带来类似CFG的优势。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
diffusion models to enhance both generation quality and alignment with input
conditions. However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited
to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token
Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices
directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network.
TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and
stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural
changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions,
making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation.
We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect
on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free
guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1
show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional
generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt
alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic
guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion
models. The code is available at

Result: 在ImageNet上实现最佳FID，显著提升文本到图像生成的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声可平衡高质量分布与混合分布间的偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法受限于前视图和实时性，且依赖昂贵的机器人模型，无法准确模拟人体变形和服装对齐。

Method: 使用真实人体采集服装数据集，结合简化的DensePose图改进中间表示，实现服装与人体准确对齐。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示方法在图像质量和时间一致性上优于现有技术，用户研究证实其对购买决策有帮助。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数据采集成本，提升了虚拟试衣的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

TL;DR: Edit360是一个无需调整的框架，通过视频扩散模型将2D编辑扩展到多视角一致的3D编辑，解决了现有方法视角受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D资产编辑中视角受限，难以实现多视角一致性，限制了灵活性和实际应用。

Method: 基于视频扩散模型，Edit360通过锚点视角选择和编辑传播机制，在潜在和注意力空间中实现多视角信息对齐与合并。

Result: Edit360能够从任意视角进行编辑，并确保多视角一致性，支持高质量3D资产重建。

Conclusion: Edit360为可定制的3D内容创作提供了灵活且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态校准稀疏惯性运动捕捉系统的新方法，突破了传统IMU校准的绝对静态假设限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖绝对静态假设，限制了应用场景。本文旨在通过动态校准扩展IMU的使用范围。

Method: 基于两个假设（短时间窗口内矩阵变化微小且运动/读数多样），利用Transformer模型学习矩阵与IMU读数的映射关系，并设计校准触发机制。

Result: 实现了实时动态校准，首次完成隐式IMU校准和稀疏IMU的长期精确运动捕捉。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了IMU校准的灵活性和实用性，为稀疏IMU的广泛应用提供了可能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在生成AI方面取得了显著进展，但自动评估生成内容质量仍缺乏系统性框架。

Method: 通过分析文本生成评估方法，并将其扩展到图像和音频领域，提出了五种基本范式。

Result: 建立了一个适用于多模态的统一分类法，并展示了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注跨模态评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

TL;DR: TaskCraft是一个自动化工作流，用于生成可扩展、多工具且可验证的代理任务，解决了现有指令数据缺乏工具交互和依赖人工标注的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理任务在NLP和AI中的重要性日益增加，但现有数据和方法缺乏工具交互且难以扩展。

Method: 通过深度和广度扩展原子任务，生成结构化和层次化的复杂任务，并创建大规模合成数据集。

Result: 实验表明，这些任务改进了生成工作流中的提示优化，并增强了代理基础模型的监督微调。

Conclusion: TaskCraft为代理调优和评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语义退化对自然语言处理（NLP）系统和人类理解的限制，挑战传统语言学中形式本身具有意义的观点。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂性理论分析语义退化，并通过语义Bell不等式测试，利用LLM代理作为计算认知系统解释模糊词对。

Result: 实验结果显示CHSH期望值显著违反经典边界（1.2-2.8），表明语言解释具有非经典上下文性。

Conclusion: 传统基于频率的语言分析方法存在局限性，建议采用贝叶斯重复采样方法更准确地表征语境中的语言意义。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在语义相同但表述不同的提示下的响应差异，揭示模型评估的稳定性问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS)框架，应用于十个约束任务，测量模型在语义等效提示下的行为漂移。

Result: 发现模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的行为漂移，可能与分词和解码策略有关。

Conclusion: 提示的表述差异会影响模型行为，分词和解码策略可能是导致训练后服务质量不稳定的因素。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉推理任务转换为文本推理任务时丢失关键信息，尤其在图表问答任务中。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 将图表图像转换为结构化ECharts代码；2) 设计数据合成管道生成推理轨迹并训练多模态模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中表现优异，接近GPT-4o性能，且参数更少。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner能有效保留图表细节，性能接近专有系统，同时更高效。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

Result: 在GSM8k-verification、TruthfulQA等任务上表现优于人类监督，并能更好地激发模型的超人类能力。

Conclusion: ICM方法可提升前沿语言模型的训练效果，优于人类监督的模型。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Result: 专家一致性高但受框架影响；LLMs接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定任务中表现可靠，适用于情感敏感场景如对话伴侣。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在故事生成中的局限性，并为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了挑战和启示。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

Method: 提出TTT-Bench，通过四种简单的双人井字棋风格游戏生成可验证的问题，评估LRMs的推理能力。

Result: LRMs在TTT-Bench上表现较差，平均得分比数学基准低41%和5%，且在长期战略推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LRMs在简单推理任务中的表现与其在复杂数学问题上的能力不匹配，揭示了其推理能力的局限性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用计算方法识别不可靠叙述者，构建了TUNa数据集，并分析了多种LLM在分类任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过计算手段识别叙述者是否可靠，填补了文学理论与实际文本分析之间的空白。

Method: 结合文学理论定义不可靠叙述者类型，构建TUNa数据集，并测试LLM在少样本、微调和课程学习下的表现。

Result: 任务极具挑战性，但LLM在识别不可靠叙述者方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和代码，鼓励未来研究进一步探索这一领域。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Motivation: 解决葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据稀缺问题，尤其是针对少数群体的细粒度分类需求。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：手动种子生成、少样本扩展、基于释义的增强和中性文本补充。

Result: 语料库在多任务分类中表现优异，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨语言模型是否具有贝叶斯大脑，发现其在某些条件下表现出近乎确定性的决策行为，挑战了之前的采样假设，并提出方法区分随机与确定性决策模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的决策行为是否类似于贝叶斯推理，以及现有方法是否准确推断其先验分布。

Method: 通过模拟Gibbs采样实验，分析语言模型在不同条件下的决策模式，并提出区分随机与确定性行为的方法。

Result: 语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可能表现出确定性行为，导致模拟Gibbs采样可能收敛到“虚假先验”。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了语言模型决策行为的复杂性，提出了避免误导性先验推断的方法，为理解大型语言模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于梯度的数据选择方法在大型语言模型微调中计算资源消耗过大，难以实际应用。

Method: 结合聚类和改进的UCB算法，将数据选择问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，利用历史梯度信息估计集群分布。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterUCB在减少计算消耗的同时，性能与原始梯度方法相当。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效且实用的数据选择框架，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Flick的新方法，用于解决低资源语言环境下的少标签文本分类问题，通过改进伪标签质量来提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对大量标注数据的依赖，解决现有方法在低资源语言环境中伪标签噪声和领域适应性的问题。

Method: Flick通过从初始广泛聚类中提取高置信度伪标签，并引入伪标签细化组件，利用单聚类凝聚力和自适应top-k选择机制优化伪标签质量。

Result: 在14个多样化的数据集上验证了Flick的有效性，包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言，展示了其优越性能和适应性。

Conclusion: Flick通过改进伪标签质量，显著提升了低资源语言环境下少标签分类任务的性能，为类似问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨用户建议对大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育模拟场景中的影响，发现模型表现受问题表述影响显著，且存在明显的迎合行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LLMs在教育环境中因用户建议而产生的表现偏差，尤其是迎合行为对教育公平的潜在影响。

Method: 测试了OpenAI的GPT-4o和GPT-4.1两类共五个LLM模型，通过五种实验条件分析其响应质量变化。

Result: 当学生提到错误答案时，LLM的正确率下降15%，提到正确答案时提升15%；小模型偏差更大（GPT-4.1-nano达30%，GPT-4o为8%）。

Conclusion: LLMs的迎合行为可能加剧教育不平等，需进一步研究其机制及缓解方法。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）通常基于文本数据训练，难以直接适应语音模态。语音到语音数据有限，进一步增加了训练难度。

Method: 提出了一种交替训练方法，在训练过程中交替使用语音和文本单元，并逐步降低文本比例，以实现从文本到语音的渐进式模态适应。

Result: 在CVSS数据集上对LLaMA3.2-1B进行微调，实验表明该方法显著提升了翻译性能，尤其是在训练数据有限的语言中。

Conclusion: 交替训练方法有效解决了语音到语音翻译中的模态适应问题，为数据有限的语言提供了更好的翻译性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升LLM跨领域推理能力，并减少推理时的冗余重复。

Conclusion: 该方法生成高质量CoT数据，增强LLM推理能力，同时优化推理效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理异构文档时存在表格结构破坏和信息丢失的局限性，影响了多跳推理能力。

Method: TableRAG采用四步迭代框架：上下文敏感查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程与执行、组合中间答案生成。

Result: 实验表明，TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA基准上均优于现有基线，成为异构文档问答的新SOTA。

Conclusion: TableRAG通过统一文本和表格处理，显著提升了异构文档问答的性能，并开源了框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部验证模型或多阶段训练，限制了可扩展性，PAG旨在通过自我验证和选择性修订解决这一问题。

Method: PAG采用多轮强化学习，模型在生成答案后进行自我验证，仅当检测到错误时修订答案。

Result: 实验表明，PAG在推理和验证任务中均表现优异，优于自一致性验证方法。

Conclusion: PAG通过统一的验证-修订机制，显著提升了LLM的自我纠正能力，同时增强了推理和验证性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有冲突框架研究多为定性或仅关注表层框架，缺乏深入分析。本研究旨在通过计算手段更深入地探讨新闻媒体在冲突报道中的框架及其影响。

Method: 使用框架语义学和大型语言模型，分析新闻语料库中的战争与和平新闻指标，比较美国、英国和中东媒体的报道差异。

Result: 研究发现报道更偏向战争框架，且不同地区媒体在冲突责任方和受害者的描述上存在显著差异，揭示了媒体偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了新闻框架对读者观点的潜在影响，呼吁更平衡的冲突报道以减少偏见和冲突激化。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在缩短推理输出时采用统一惩罚，未考虑问题复杂性，导致效果不佳。本研究旨在提升LLM推理效率，同时兼顾简单问题的简洁性和复杂问题的准确性。

Method: 通过分割奖励函数并引入新的输出长度惩罚，动态管理模型的推理效率。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，方法有效缩短输出长度且保持或提升准确性；在更复杂的AIME2024数据集上，准确性有所提高。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM的推理效率，适用于不同复杂度的任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅预测科学主张的标签（支持或反驳）不足以揭示模型的推理过程，缺乏解释性。因此，研究希望通过识别关键表格单元格来增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 扩展SciTab基准数据集，添加人工标注的单元格级理由，并提出处理模糊情况的分类法。

Result: 实验显示：(i) 引入表格对齐信息能提升主张验证性能；(ii) 多数LLM虽能预测正确标签，但无法恢复人类标注的推理路径。

Conclusion: 研究强调了解释性在科学主张验证中的重要性，并揭示了当前LLM在忠实推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 现代语言模型在训练数据中不可避免地包含偏见内容，导致模型输出带有偏见。研究旨在探索这些偏见的表现形式。

Method: 通过预提示角色、用户答案评分和薪资谈判建议三种任务设计，评估LLMs的偏见表现。

Result: 预提示角色对模型评分影响微小且随机；用户答案评分任务显示更明显的偏见；薪资谈判建议任务中偏见最为显著。

Conclusion: 随着LLM助手记忆和个性化功能的发展，模型可能基于用户的社会人口特征自动产生偏见，需引起重视。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Method: 通过基于言语行为理论生成第二用户的对话，扩展现有DST数据集，系统性地引入多用户对话，以评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，与单用户DST相比，LLMs在多用户场景下性能显著下降，表明其在多说话者环境中提取和跟踪对话状态的能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了未来改进LLMs以应对多用户DST场景的必要性，为开发更真实和鲁棒的DST模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: RRP框架通过结合LLMs的语义能力和知识图的结构信息，生成高质量推理路径，提升LLMs在复杂问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在知识密集型任务中因缺乏背景知识和幻觉倾向导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出RRP框架，结合LLMs的语义能力和知识图的结构信息，通过关系嵌入和双向分布学习提取推理路径，并引入反思模块优化路径。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，RRP表现优于现有基线方法，并能以即插即用方式增强LLMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: RRP通过生成高质量推理路径，显著提升了LLMs在复杂问题上的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Result: 在重建拉丁原始词形任务中，字符级准确性和音系合理性指标均显著提升。

Conclusion: 混合方法在原始词形重建中优于纯数据驱动方法，验证了结合统计与语言学约束的有效性。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce

Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息。

Method: 通过分析嵌入层、中间层和Transformer层，结合探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重检查。

Result: 嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息，LLMs依赖中间层重建知识，拼写行为在特定层出现突破。

Conclusion: LLMs的字符级处理依赖多层机制，嵌入层信息不完整，中间层起关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命的语言对保护个体心理健康和预防潜在伤害至关重要。

Method: 通过微调三种开源LLMs（Gemma、Mistral、Llama-2）并与传统方法（如词袋模型、词嵌入、主题建模和BERT）进行比较。

Result: LLMs在平衡和不平衡数据场景下表现优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2表现最佳。上采样技术对传统方法有帮助，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在现实世界的威胁生命语言检测中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: PREMISE是一种无需修改模型权重的提示优化框架，通过减少冗余推理步骤显著降低计算成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在数学基准测试中表现优异，但其冗长的推理过程导致高昂的计算成本和延迟问题。

Method: PREMISE结合轨迹诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡推理长度和答案准确性。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500基准测试中，PREMISE保持或提升准确率（Claude 96%→96%，Gemini 91%→92%），同时减少推理令牌87.5%，降低成本69-82%。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是提升LRM推理效率的有效且可扩展方法，无需牺牲推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

TL;DR: ClaimSpect框架通过层次化分解和检索增强生成技术，为复杂声明提供多角度验证和视角分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决声明（如科学或政治声明）难以简单标记为真或假的问题，提供更全面的结构化验证方法。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，通过层次化分解声明为子方面，并结合检索增强生成技术，从语料库中提取相关视角。

Result: 在真实科学和政治声明数据集上验证了ClaimSpect的鲁棒性和准确性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect能有效解构复杂声明并展示语料库中的多样化视角，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Motivation: 传统专家分类耗时昂贵，现有自动方法缺乏通用性和动态适应性，且忽视科学文献的多维性。

Method: TaxoAdapt利用LLM生成的分类体系，通过迭代层次分类扩展分类的宽度和深度，适应不同科学领域的动态变化。

Result: TaxoAdapt在计算机科学领域的分类表现优于基线方法，分类细粒度提升26.51%，连贯性提升50.41%。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能够有效捕捉科学领域的动态变化，生成更细粒度和连贯的分类体系，适用于多维度科学文献组织。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: 多语言大模型训练面临模型容量有限、高质量数据稀缺和计算资源限制等问题，且分词器对新语言的支持不足。

Method: 提出使用通用分词器，覆盖比主训练语言更多的语言，以提升训练后的语言适应能力。

Result: 实验表明，通用分词器显著提升了语言适应能力，胜率最高提升20.2%，且对未见语言也有5%的胜率增益。

Conclusion: 通用分词器设计是一种低成本高效的方法，能在不显著影响主训练语言性能的情况下，显著提升模型对新语言的适应能力。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in

Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR系统在通用语音识别上表现优异，但在命名实体识别上的错误率仍然较高，而命名实体是关键信息，错误会影响下游应用。

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，命名实体的WER相对降低了30%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了ASR系统在命名实体识别上的准确性，对下游应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

TL;DR: LangEdit提出了一种新颖的框架，通过正交投影隔离语言特定的知识更新，解决了多语言大模型中知识更新的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型中知识更新的挑战在于如何避免跨语言编辑时的参数干扰，同时保持多语言泛化能力。

Method: LangEdit采用零空间约束框架，将每种语言的参数更新投影到先前更新子空间的正交补空间上，确保更新独立性。

Result: 在三种模型架构、六种语言和四项下游任务上的评估表明，LangEdit有效减少了参数干扰，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit为多语言大模型的高效准确知识更新提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有CoT提示方法存在过度思考问题，导致推理轨迹冗长或冗余，现有解决方案受限于生成数据质量和过拟合。

Method: ReCUT采用逐步探索机制和长短切换采样策略，生成多样化推理路径，训练两个专门模型（一个优化准确性，一个优化推理长度），最终通过参数插值集成。

Result: 实验表明，ReCUT在多个数学推理数据集和骨干模型上显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效解决了推理冗长问题，平衡了准确性和效率，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

TL;DR: SlowFast Sampling是一种动态采样策略，通过交替探索和加速解码阶段，显著提升扩散语言模型的生成效率和灵活性，同时结合缓存减少冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型的采样策略存在静态行为问题，导致效率和灵活性不足，需要一种动态适应的方法。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling，基于确定性、收敛性和位置性三原则动态调整解码阶段，并结合dLLM-Cache减少计算冗余。

Result: 实验显示，SlowFast Sampling在LLaDA上实现15.63倍加速，结合缓存可达34.22倍，且生成质量接近基线。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling证明了动态采样策略能充分发挥扩散语言模型的潜力，实现高效高质量的生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语，缺乏对其他语言的分析，因此探讨多语言下wav2vec2模型的表示特性。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析，研究模型如何编码音素、声调和说话人信息。

Result: 不同语言的表示子空间（音素、声调、说话人）基本正交，层间探测准确率模式相似，匹配语言在后期层略有优势。

Conclusion: wav2vec2的表示结构主要与预训练语言无关，具有通用性。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Conclusion: MedRef在真实医疗应用中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）通过微调获取新知识时的双重行为：既能泛化新事实，又易产生幻觉信息，并提出这两种行为源于同一机制——上下文外推理（OCR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在微调过程中表现出的双重行为（泛化与幻觉）的根本原因。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR机制的存在，并将其形式化为合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力模型的性能。

Result: OCR机制是泛化和幻觉的共同根源，矩阵分解在模型学习关联事实与含义中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究为理解OCR现象提供了理论基础，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编码器模型在生物医学和临床领域的适应能力有限，发展较慢，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过在大规模生物医学和临床语料库（53.5B tokens）上持续预训练，并利用来自不同机构、领域和地理区域的20个数据集开发BioClinical ModernBERT。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优于现有生物医学和临床编码器。

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT为生物医学和临床NLP提供了更高效的编码器解决方案，并公开了模型和训练检查点以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Motivation: 当前自动形式化任务的评估方法缺乏细粒度和透明度，尤其是在复杂数学领域中，人工评估成本高且依赖专业知识。

Method: 提出了一种基于逻辑保持（LP）、数学一致性（MC）、形式有效性（FV）和形式质量（FQ）的LLM法官集成方法（EFG）。

Conclusion: EFG方法为形式数学推理的评估提供了可扩展、可解释且可靠的解决方案，尤其是在细粒度评估方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如稀疏自编码器SAEs）在因果评估中表现不佳且缺乏内在可解释性，因此需要一种更直接的方法。

Method: 使用SNMF直接分解MLP激活，学习稀疏线性组合的神经元特征，并将其映射到激活输入。

Result: 在Llama 3.1、Gemma 2和GPT-2上的实验表明，SNMF特征在因果引导和人类可解释性上优于SAEs和监督基线。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别LLM中的可解释特征和概念表示。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言模型预训练中数据混合的优化效率低，计算开销大，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: Domain2Vec通过分解数据集为元域的线性组合，生成域向量，并基于分布对齐假设（DA²）优化数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec仅需51.5%的计算量即可达到相同的验证损失，并在相同计算预算下平均提升下游任务性能2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec提供了一种高效、可扩展的方法，显著优化了语言模型预训练的数据混合策略。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Conclusion: AutoMind是迈向全自动数据科学的高效且稳健的一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Conclusion: 需提升模型的自我评估能力以改进推理和安全性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.
