*Shaibal Saha,Lanyu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientQuant是一种针对混合卷积-Transformer模型的结构感知后训练量化方法，显著降低延迟并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合卷积-Transformer模型在CV任务中表现优异，但资源消耗大，现有后训练量化方法对其效果有限。

Method: 采用均匀量化处理卷积块，对数量化处理Transformer块。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上实现2.5×-8.7×的延迟降低，精度损失极小，边缘设备上表现高效。

Conclusion: EfficientQuant为混合模型的边缘部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

### [2] [Adaptive Object Detection with ESRGAN-Enhanced Resolution & Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11122)
*Divya Swetha K,Ziaul Haque Choudhury,Hemanta Kumar Bhuyan,Biswajit Brahma,Nilayam Kumar Kamila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合ESRGAN和Faster R-CNN的方法，用于从低分辨率图像中提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像中目标检测性能不佳的问题，特别是在图像质量不一致的应用场景中。

Method: 使用ESRGAN作为预处理步骤增强图像质量，再通过Faster R-CNN进行目标检测。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在低分辨率图像上的检测性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为图像质量不一致或受限的应用提供了有效的解决方案，实现了图像质量提升与高效目标检测的平衡。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

### [3] [Technical Report for Argoverse2 Scenario Mining Challenges on Iterative Error Correction and Spatially-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11124)
*Yifei Chen,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefAV框架通过LLM将自然语言查询转换为可执行代码以挖掘自动驾驶场景，但面临代码错误和参数解释不准确的问题。本文提出两种改进：迭代代码生成机制和专用提示工程，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成代码时的运行时错误和复杂空间关系参数解释不准确的问题，提升自动驾驶场景挖掘的可靠性。

Method: 1. 引入容错迭代代码生成机制，通过错误反馈重新提示LLM优化代码；2. 采用专用提示工程改进LLM对空间关系函数的理解和应用。

Result: 在Argoverse 2验证集上，使用多种LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Gemini 2.5 Pro）均表现提升，其中Gemini 2.5 Pro在测试集上HOTA-Temporal得分为52.37。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了场景挖掘的可靠性和精度，为自动驾驶系统开发提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

### [4] [Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126)
*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于StarDist算法的铁矿石球团分类方法，旨在解决传统算法在密集和不稳定环境中分类和测量精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统图像分类和分割方法（如ViT和Mask R-CNN）在铁矿石球团分类中效果不佳，需要一种更精确的方法来识别和分析密集环境中的物体。

Method: 采用StarDist算法进行图像分割和轮廓提取，分类球团并测量其物理尺寸，特别关注平滑边界物体的检测。

Result: 新方法显著提高了物理尺寸测量的准确性，并改进了球团尺寸分布的分析。

Conclusion: 通过StarDist算法，本研究为复杂环境下的球团分类和测量提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

### [5] [Segment This Thing: Foveated Tokenization for Efficient Point-Prompted Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11131)
*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT是一种高效的图像分割模型，通过单点提示生成单一分割区域，采用可变分辨率补丁标记化减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高图像分割效率，同时避免缩小模型规模，通过聚焦输入图像的关键区域。

Method: 提取以提示点为中心的图像裁剪，并应用可变分辨率补丁标记化，远离提示点的补丁降采样率更高。

Result: STT在分割基准测试中表现优异，计算成本大幅降低，可在消费级硬件上实时运行。

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且实用的工具，适用于增强现实或机器人应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

### [6] [Gender Fairness of Machine Learning Algorithms for Pain Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11132)
*Dylan Green,Yuting Shang,Jiaee Cheong,Yang Liu,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于机器学习和深度学习的自动疼痛检测模型在性别公平性上的表现，发现所有模型均存在性别偏见，尽管ViT模型准确率最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动疼痛检测在医疗领域潜力巨大，但模型在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性研究不足。

Method: 使用UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database，比较传统ML算法（L SVM、RBF SVM）和DL方法（CNN、ViT）的性能与公平性。

Result: ViT模型准确率最高，但所有模型均表现出性别偏见，揭示了准确性与公平性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 需采用公平性感知技术以减少自动医疗系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

### [7] [Monocular 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Implicit Camera Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11133)
*Christos Pantazopoulos,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从2D关键点输入估计3D手部关节的优化流程，无需相机参数知识，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单张彩色图像中3D手部关节估计的挑战，如深度信息缺失、遮挡和复杂关节结构。

Method: 采用关键点对齐步骤和指尖损失函数，避免对相机参数的依赖。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中表现优异，对“野外”图像处理鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需相机参数的情况下，实现了与现有技术相当的性能，并展示了2D关键点估计精度的重要性。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

### [8] [ContextLoss: Context Information for Topology-Preserving Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11134)
*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数ContextLoss（CLoss），通过考虑拓扑错误的完整上下文，提高图像分割的拓扑正确性，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构（如血管、膜或道路）的拓扑结构至关重要，拓扑错误可能严重影响实际应用（如导航）。现有方法基于关键像素掩码，但缺乏对拓扑错误上下文的全面考虑。

Method: 提出了CLoss损失函数，通过考虑关键像素掩码中拓扑错误的完整上下文，增强网络对拓扑错误的关注。同时提出了两种直观的指标来验证连通性改进。

Result: 在多个公开数据集和自有的3D纳米成像数据集上验证，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复了比其他方法多44%的缺失连接。

Conclusion: CLoss通过引入上下文信息显著提升了拓扑正确性，为图像分割任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

### [9] [JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11136)
*Paul Couairon,Loick Chambon,Louis Serrano,Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard,Matthieu Cord,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR是一种轻量级且灵活的特征上采样器，能够将任何基础视觉编码器的低分辨率特征提升到任意目标分辨率，通过注意力模块和SFT调制实现语义对齐，无需高分辨率监督即可泛化到更高输出尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率输出难以满足下游任务对高分辨率模态的需求，因此需要一种高效的特征上采样方法。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块和SFT调制，将低分辨率语义丰富的键与高分辨率查询对齐，实现特征上采样。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能够有效恢复细粒度空间细节，并在多种下游任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR是一种高效的特征上采样解决方案，适用于广泛的下游任务。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

### [10] [Autonomous Computer Vision Development with Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11140)
*Jin Kim,Muhammad Wahi-Anwa,Sangyun Park,Shawn Shin,John M. Hoffman,Matthew S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文展示了如何利用基于大型语言模型（LLM）的Agentic AI方法，通过自然语言提示自主构建计算机视觉系统，并成功应用于医学图像分析任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Agentic AI在复杂推理、规划和工具配置中的潜力，减少传统计算机视觉应用中数据科学家的手动干预。

Method: 扩展开源Cognitive AI环境SimpleMind，引入基于LLM的代理（OpenManus），通过自然语言提示自动分解任务并配置工具，生成YAML格式的配置文件，自主完成训练和推理。

Result: 代理成功配置并测试了50张胸部X光图像，肺部、心脏和肋骨的分割平均Dice分数分别为0.96、0.82和0.83。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了Agentic AI在计算机视觉应用中自主规划和工具配置的可行性，为减少人工干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

### [11] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半监督语义分割框架，通过模糊伪标签、不确定性动态加权、自适应类别平衡和轻量对比正则化，有效利用未标记数据并提升小类和模糊区域的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中未标记数据利用不足、类别不平衡偏差加剧以及预测不确定性忽视的问题。

Method: 提出四个核心组件：模糊伪标签保留软类别分布；不确定性动态加权通过熵调整像素贡献；自适应类别平衡动态调整损失；轻量对比正则化优化特征嵌入。

Result: 在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，尤其在小类和模糊区域的分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架将不确定性转化为学习资源，有效提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing
AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on
teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time
data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights
and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual
dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review
dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National
Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and
its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual
workloads and encourages constructive reflection. Although the current version
does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

### [13] [AlignHuman: Improving Motion and Fidelity via Timestep-Segment Preference Optimization for Audio-Driven Human Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11144)
*Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Wang Liao,Jiaqi Yang,Zerong zheng,Weihong Zeng,Han Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman框架通过偏好优化和分治训练策略，优化了人类视频生成中运动自然性与视觉保真度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类视频生成在运动自然性和视觉保真度之间存在矛盾，需要一种方法同时优化这两个目标。

Method: 提出AlignHuman框架，结合偏好优化和分治策略，利用时间步分段偏好优化（TPO）和两个专用LoRA模块分别优化运动动态和视觉保真度。

Result: 实验表明，AlignHuman在减少推理步数（从100步降至30步）的同时保持生成质量，实现了3.3倍的加速。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过时间步分段优化和专家模块，有效平衡了运动自然性与视觉保真度，显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.
Our dataset and code, aiming to catalyze multimodal medical AI research and

TL;DR: LLM-to-Phy3D是一种新型方法，通过物理约束优化LLM生成的3D对象，显著提升其物理可行性和几何新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-to-3D模型缺乏物理知识，导致生成的3D对象脱离现实物理约束，限制了其在工程设计中的应用。

Method: 引入在线黑盒优化循环，结合视觉和物理评估，迭代优化提示以生成物理可行的3D对象。

Result: 在车辆设计优化中，LLM-to-Phy3D比传统模型提升4.5%至106.7%的物理性能。

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D为物理AI在科学和工程领域的应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无标记数据情况下从EEG和图像数据中恢复心理目标的问题，填补了自校准方法在此领域的空白。

Method: 提出CURSOR框架，利用未标记数据学习预测图像相似度分数，并用于排名和生成新刺激。

Result: 实验表明CURSOR能预测与人类感知判断相关的相似度分数，并生成与心理目标无法区分的新刺激。

Conclusion: CURSOR为无标记数据下的心理目标恢复提供了有效解决方案，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption是一个自动框架，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）生成多样化的视频描述句子，解决了现有视频字幕评测的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕评测存在关键点不足、数据创建成本高和评测范围有限的问题。

Method: 提出AutoCaption框架，通过MCTS迭代生成多样化的视频描述句子，构建细粒度评测基准MCTS-VCB。

Result: 评测20多个MLLMs，Gemini-1.5-Pro得分最高（F1=71.2）；微调InternVL2.5-8B后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: AutoCaption有效提升视频字幕评测的全面性，生成的数据可用于模型微调，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Abstract: Retrieving accurate details from documents is a crucial task, especially when
handling a combination of scanned images and native digital formats. This
document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files
are interpreted through layout-aware libraries. The extracted raw text is
subsequently analyzed by an LLM to identify key-value pairs and resolve
ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and
processing speed. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over
traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced
flexibility and semantic precision across different document categories

Result: 发现VLMs在视觉社交-语用推理方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交推理中仍有改进空间，新任务和数据集为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and

Result: 在多模态医学影像中验证了方法的有效性，提高了诊断准确性和分类可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学影像诊断提供了一种高效、可靠的解决方案，尤其在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Conclusion: WaveFormer在轻量化和高精度方面表现出色，适用于资源受限的嵌入式系统。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Conclusion: SF-TMAT为恶劣场景下的无人机目标检测提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病研究提供了高效精准的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，需要更有效的车辆速度检测方法。

Method: 使用YOLOv11模型，训练了800张鸟瞰图，识别车辆车道并分类为轿车和重型车辆。

Result: 模型在MAE和MSE上表现优异，分别为0.97 mph和0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型能有效解决车辆速度和分类问题，适用于交通监控。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: GynSurg的发布将推动妇科腹腔镜手术领域的智能系统发展，并促进手术分析和发现。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像生成模型的快速发展带来了潜在的滥用风险，如深度伪造和误导性视觉证据的制造，因此需要有效的真实性验证机制。

Method: 通过基于聚类的策略，C-reweight将同一聚类中的标记视为等效，从而减少重标记不匹配问题，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可靠的图像合成设定了新标准，解决了传统水印技术在图像生成模型中的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型对图像内容的空间组织能力，为多模态任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中常产生幻觉（生成输入图像中不存在的对象信息），影响模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应和目标信息的数据集，应用偏好学习方法专注于特定目标区域，过滤无关信号以纠正幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，\mymethod在多个视觉幻觉任务中有效减少幻觉，提升模型可靠性和性能，同时不影响整体表现。

Conclusion: \mymethod通过针对性优化，显著改善了多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在预测骨骼位置时未能有效保持连接性，导致拓扑错误和变形问题。

Result: 生成的骨骼结构具有更高的解剖合理性和变形性能。

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过综合优化策略，显著提升了自动骨骼绑定的质量和效率。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Result: FSCA在多个数据集和指标上优于基线方法，用户级准确率达90%（仅需10样本/用户）。

Conclusion: FSCA在现实应用中具有强大的审计潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Motivation: 音频-视觉分割（AVS）面临跨模态对齐的挑战，现有方法未能有效结合多模态知识或解决特征空间差异问题。

Result: 在单源、多源、语义数据集及零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过文本桥接设计有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 在数字病理学中，癌症亚型分类模型需要大量专家标注，而标注资源有限。因此，引入不确定性感知机制以优化标注效率和模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注数据有限的情况下显著提升了癌症亚型分类的性能，为数字病理学提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNNs在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，且现有防御机制（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且无法泛化到未见攻击。

Method: 提出V2LMs，并评估其两种部署模式：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务）。

Result: V2LMs在对抗攻击下精度下降小于8%，而DNNs下降33%-46%。Tandem Mode在保持鲁棒性的同时更节省内存。

Conclusion: V2LMs为AV感知系统提供了更安全、更具韧性的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

<details>

Motivation: 传统SCD方法依赖理想化的查询-参考图像对齐，而实际应用中参考图像通常视角不同。论文旨在解决这一局限性，提出更实用的ECD任务。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过利用多个参考候选和聚合语义丰富的表示来检测变化，避免了视角不对齐和有限视野的问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准测试中，新框架显著优于现有方法的简单组合，并接近理想化设置下的性能。

Conclusion: ECD任务和提出的框架为实际场景中的变化检测提供了更实用的解决方案，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and

thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced

These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

*Xiao Xu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Manager的轻量级插件，通过自适应聚合单模态专家的多层级知识，提升视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BridgeTower模型在单模态表征利用、多层级语义知识灵活性和高分辨率数据集评估方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ManagerTower模型，在跨模态层中引入Manager插件，并扩展到多模态大语言模型架构。

Result: 在4个下游视觉语言任务中表现优异，并在20个数据集上显著提升LLaVA-OV的零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件和多网格算法的协同作用能改善视觉表征，缓解语义模糊，提升性能。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

*Samuel Cerezo,Javier Civera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的GNSS-惯性初始化策略，通过延迟使用全局GNSS测量数据，转而依赖相对距离残差，以提高初始估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台的初始状态估计常因初始测量信息有限而导致估计不准确，容易陷入局部最优解。

Method: 提出了一种基于Hessian矩阵奇异值演化的准则，用于确定何时切换到全局GNSS测量数据。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接使用全局GNSS数据的策略表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提高初始化的准确性和鲁棒性，避免局部最优解。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIMA-Q的新型后训练量化方法，用于解决Vision Transformers（ViTs）在低比特量化下的精度下降问题。通过分析Hessian引导的量化损失，作者发现传统Hessian近似的局限性，并提出了一种基于KL散度与Fisher信息矩阵（FIM）连接的快速计算方法，以及一种高效的FIM近似方法DPLR-FIM。实验表明，该方法在低比特量化下显著提升了精度。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q为ViTs的后训练量化提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案，尤其在低比特量化场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such
events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose
SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to
detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This
approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转估计在计算机视觉和机器人任务中至关重要，但传统方法通常是非线性非凸优化问题，设计复杂。本文旨在提供一种更简单且高效的方法。

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，为旋转估计问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

TL;DR: EyeSimVQA是一种基于自由能的自修复视频质量评估框架，通过双分支架构和生物启发设计，在性能和可解释性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）因时空复杂性和预训练模型限制，现有方法难以直接集成增强模块。

Method: 提出双分支架构（美学分支和技术分支），结合自由能自修复模块和生物启发预测头。

Result: 在五个公开VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能和可解释性提升。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA为VQA提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

TL;DR: DaMO是一种数据高效的大型语言模型，专为视频领域设计，通过层次化双流架构和全局残差提升时间推理和多模态理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在细粒度时间推理方面存在局限，难以精确响应特定视频时刻，尤其是在监督受限的情况下。

Method: 提出Temporal-aware Fuseformer，采用层次化双流架构捕获时间动态并融合视觉和音频信息，结合全局残差提高计算效率。通过四阶段渐进训练范式增强多模态对齐、语义基础和时序推理能力。

Result: 在时间定位和视频QA任务中，DaMO表现优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确时间对齐的任务中。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动编辑视觉线索的流程和VFaith-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉推理能力及其对视觉信息的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管长链思维（CoT）能提升MLLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，尤其是视觉线索提取与推理过程的贡献难以量化。

Method: 设计了基于GPT-Image-1的自动编辑流程，生成对比问答对，并通过修改关键视觉线索改变答案，构建VFaith-Bench基准。

Result: VFaith-Bench包含755个条目和人类标注任务，测试主流模型显示其视觉推理能力与视觉感知的关系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs推理能力的来源，为未来模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Result: 精度87%，召回率91.7%，推理时间1.4毫秒，适合实时应用。

Conclusion: 方法有效，但可通过增加数据集或图像增强进一步优化。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal

vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC

Conclusion: A²LC通过自动化校正和自适应平衡机制，显著提升了标签校正的效率和效果，为语义分割任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM）和正则化策略DISCO，用于解决预测任务中模型依赖无关信号的问题，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测任务中，模型可能依赖无关信号（如光照条件）而非真实因果关系，导致预测结果不理想。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入SAM模型分析反因果设置中的信息路径，并提出DISCO正则化策略，利用条件距离相关性优化回归任务中的条件独立性。

Result: 实验表明，DISCO在多种偏差缓解任务中表现优异，可作为传统核方法的替代方案。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为反因果预测问题提供了有效解决方案，能够减少无关信号的干扰，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线图像中违禁物品的外观与自然物体差异大，且物体间严重重叠，导致分割困难。

Method: 集成Segment Anything Model（SAM）以利用其先验知识，设计遮挡感知的双层掩码解码器模块，并标注了两个大规模遮挡数据集。

Result: 在PIDray-A和PIXray-A数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了X射线图像中违禁物品的分割问题，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态混合课程LoRA专家（D-MoLE）方法，通过动态调整MLLM的架构来解决任务架构冲突和模态不平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用固定架构，难以适应新任务，且存在任务架构冲突和模态不平衡问题。

Method: 提出D-MoLE方法，包括动态层间专家分配器和梯度驱动的跨模态课程，以动态调整架构并平衡模态更新。

Result: 实验表明D-MoLE显著优于现有基线，平均提升15%。

Conclusion: 这是首个从架构角度研究MLLM持续学习的工作，为解决任务适应性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在医学图像和报告的多模态自监督学习中存在负样本选择不当、忽视局部细节和低层次特征的问题，影响了诊断准确性。

Method: 1）通过跨模态注意力扩展k-means聚类用于多模态负样本选择；2）引入跨模态掩码图像重建模块（CM-MIR）增强局部特征交互。

Result: 在五个下游数据集上的分类、检测和分割任务中，CM-CGNS在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS通过优化负样本选择和局部特征提取，显著提升了医学视觉表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Result: 分割任务得分为0.8601，分类任务得分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 该方法在气道影像分析中表现出较高的预测能力，为肺纤维化患者的生存预测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Result: ViT的测试准确率最高（90%），且其关注的动作区域更准确，而其他模型易受背景干扰。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在数据效率和性能上优于传统方法，且可解释性技术有助于诊断模型失败原因。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA为多表格视觉问答提供了有效评估工具，并通过微调改进了模型能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上，DMAF-Net表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net通过动态平衡模态贡献和结构关系，显著提升了多模态医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的内容感知机制和状态空间模型，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能与效率。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上表现优异，超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态多模型融合方法有效解决异常检测的多面挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等长运动因其便利性和隐私性受欢迎，但缺乏专家指导可能导致姿势错误、受伤和用户流失。

Method: 发布了一个包含3,600个视频片段的多类别等长运动数据集，并评估了包括图网络在内的先进模型，同时提出了一种新的三部分评估指标。

Result: 研究结果表明，智能个性化家庭锻炼系统的可行性得到提升，系统还可应用于康复和物理治疗等领域。

Conclusion: 该系统通过直接向用户提供专家级诊断，扩展了其在健身和其他运动相关领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图领域缺乏特定领域的预训练模型，现有自监督学习方法在应对高样本相似性和低PSNR输入时表现不佳。

Method: DISCOVR结合了基于聚类的视频编码器和在线图像编码器，通过语义聚类蒸馏损失将解剖知识从图像编码器传递到视频编码器。

Result: 在六个超声心动图数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本和线性探测设置中均优于现有方法，并实现了更好的分割迁移效果。

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支设计和知识蒸馏，显著提升了超声视频表示学习的性能，适用于不同人群的超声数据。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

*Guang Liang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ是一种高效且有效的ViT量化框架，通过两阶段策略（先量化激活，后量化权重）显著提升了4位量化的性能，同时降低了计算成本和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ和QAT方法在ViT量化中存在显著缺陷，如PTQ精度下降严重，QAT计算成本高且泛化能力有限。

Method: GPLQ采用两阶段策略：第一阶段量化激活并保留FP32权重，第二阶段量化权重。

Result: GPLQ比现有QAT方法快100倍，内存占用低于FP32训练，4位量化模型性能接近FP32模型。

Conclusion: GPLQ为ViT量化提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案，并计划开源工具包。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在VLT任务上缺乏系统评估和理解，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析数据质量（提出AibTrans数据集）、评测11种商业和6种开源模型、提出Density-Aware Evaluation方法（DA Score）进行研究。

Result: 发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，提出平衡多语言微调策略以提升模型适应性。

Conclusion: 建立了VLT新评测基准，为未来研究提供了数据、模型和评估方法的改进方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本3D检测提供了可行方案，适用于多种道路场景。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Motivation: 由于全景图像的球面几何和投影变形特性，现有的平面图像编辑方法难以直接应用，因此需要专门的全景图像编辑解决方案。

Method: SphereDrag采用自适应重投影（AR）处理边界不连续，大圆轨迹调整（GCTA）提高轨迹精度，球面搜索区域跟踪（SSRT）解决像素密度不均问题。

Result: 实验表明，SphereDrag在几何一致性和图像质量上显著优于现有方法，相对改进高达10.5%。

Conclusion: SphereDrag为全景图像编辑提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案，并通过PanoBench标准化评估框架验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Result: 实验表明O2Former在SAR船舶数据集上优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: O2Former通过针对性设计解决了SAR图像分割的挑战，为相关应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在图像和几何生成中实现了对齐和高质量的结果，适用于全面的3D完成。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，目前机制尚不明确。

Method: 使用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调整。

Result: 实验表明，视觉表征逐渐与语言特征对齐，但早期层存在不匹配，引发对当前适配器架构的质疑。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉与语言表征对齐的机制，并指出当前适配器架构可能并非最优。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖纯语言空间进行推理，存在语言偏见且局限于数学或科学领域，难以处理需要全面理解图像细节的复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并基于这些区域提供精确答案，结合视觉定位和语言推理的大规模SFT数据集VGR-SFT，并引入重放阶段增强多模态理解。

Result: 实验表明，VGR在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基准上表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数量，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升了4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉定位和语言推理，显著提升了多模态推理任务的性能，尤其在需要理解图像细节的任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Motivation: 探索术前身体组成指标对术后结果的预测能力，以优化手术风险评估。

Method: 使用Cox比例风险模型评估1年全因死亡率，逻辑回归评估次要结果，提取300多个CT特征。

Result: 结果显示CT提取的身体组成指标对术后结果有预测能力，性能通过C指数和IBS评估。

Conclusion: 术前CT提取的身体组成指标可用于预测结肠切除术后结果，结合临床变量效果更佳。

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决功能定位任务中的细粒度部分级定位、多有效交互区域的模糊性以及大规模数据集稀缺的问题。

Method: 利用预训练的部分感知视觉主干和文本条件热图解码器构建视觉语言模型。

Result: 模型在现有2D和3D基准测试中表现良好，并展现出开放词汇跨领域泛化的有效性。

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

TL;DR: AA-2DGS通过引入世界空间平滑核和对象空间Mip滤波器，解决了2DGS在不同采样率下的锯齿问题，提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS在训练和渲染采样率不一致时会出现严重锯齿，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出AA-2DGS，包括世界空间平滑核和对象空间Mip滤波器，约束频率内容并优化抗锯齿处理。

Result: 显著提升了不同尺度下的渲染质量，消除了高频锯齿。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS在保持几何优势的同时，有效解决了2DGS的抗锯齿问题。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索射线重排序对现有GPU射线追踪实现的性能提升潜力，尤其是对二次射线的优化。

Method: 总结现有射线排序键计算方法，提出基于终止点估计的改进方法，并在RTX内核中进行评估。

Result: 射线重排序显著提升追踪速度（1.3-2.0倍），但硬件加速阶段的排序开销难以完全抵消。

Conclusion: 射线重排序在GPU射线追踪中具有显著性能优势，但需进一步优化以降低排序开销。

Abstract: We study ray reordering as a tool for increasing the performance of existing
GPU ray tracing implementations. We focus on ray reordering that is fully
agnostic to the particular trace kernel. We summarize the existing methods for
computing the ray sorting keys and discuss their properties. We propose a novel
modification of a previously proposed method using the termination point
estimation that is well-suited to tracing secondary rays. We evaluate the ray
reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the
RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher
trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3-2.0x), but to recover the reordering overhead
in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic.

Motivation: 解决体积数据渲染中内存占用高和性能不足的问题，利用四面体网格的适应性优化路径追踪。

Method: 采用最长边二分算法构建四面体网格，设计优化的GPU算法和数据结构。

Result: GPU实现性能比常规网格提升高达30倍，支持实时渲染32样本/像素的生产级资产。

Conclusion: 四面体网格在体积数据路径追踪中具有显著优势，适合高性能实时渲染。

Abstract: We advertise the use of tetrahedral grids constructed via the longest edge
bisection algorithm for rendering volumetric data with path tracing. The key
benefits of such grids is two-fold. First, they provide a highly adaptive
space-partitioning representation that limits the memory footprint of
volumetric assets. Second, each (tetrahedral) cell has exactly 4 neighbors
within the volume (one per face of each tetrahedron) or less at boundaries. We
leverage these properties to devise optimized algorithms and data-structures to
compute and path-trace adaptive tetrahedral grids on the GPU. In practice, our
GPU implementation outperforms regular grids by up to x30 and renders
production assets in real time at 32 samples per pixel.

Method: 构建了包含多种渲染技术失真的数据集，并提出基于预训练3D CNN的CGVQM质量评估方法。

Result: 现有指标在这些失真上表现不佳（最高Pearson相关性0.78），CGVQM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CGVQM能有效评估现代渲染失真，数据集和实现已开源。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Motivation: 电信运营调度任务复杂且缺乏评估基准，阻碍了LLMs在该领域的应用潜力探索。

Method: 构建TeleEval-OS基准，包含15个数据集和13个子任务，模拟四个关键运营阶段，并采用零样本和少样本评估方法测试14种LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，开源LLMs在特定场景下表现优于闭源LLMs，展示了其在电信运营调度中的潜力。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS为LLMs在电信运营调度中的应用提供了评估工具，开源LLMs在该领域具有显著价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态RAG系统对证据顺序高度敏感，导致性能不稳定和推理偏差，因此需要研究位置偏差的影响。

Method: 通过文本、图像及混合模态任务的实验，引入位置敏感指数（PSI_p）和可视化框架分析注意力分配模式。

Result: 多模态交互加剧了位置偏差，且偏差随检索范围对数增长。

Conclusion: 研究为RAG系统的位置感知分析提供了理论基础，建议采用证据重排序或去偏策略以提高系统可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language

dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在道德推理中存在义务性关键词偏见（DKB），即在提示中加入模态表达（如“必须”或“应该”）时，LLMs倾向于将非义务性情境判断为义务。通过结合少量示例和推理提示的策略可以缓解此偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在道德义务判断中的行为，尤其是模态表达对其判断的影响，填补了LLM对齐研究中关于义务判断的空白。

Method: 通过分析LLMs在不同模态表达下的义务判断行为，提出DKB现象，并设计结合少量示例和推理提示的缓解策略。

Result: LLMs在模态表达存在时，将90%以上的常识情境判断为义务，且此现象在不同LLM家族、问题类型和答案格式中一致。

Conclusion: 模态表达作为语言框架显著影响LLMs的规范性决策，需解决此类偏见以确保判断对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

Result: 机器评估和人类研究表明，该接口可作为大型语言模型的辅助模块，实现对原型模型的精确有效控制。

Conclusion: 该接口架构为设计师提供了一种自然且高效的原型控制方式，弥合了语言与建模之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言查询中更容易产生与视觉输入不一致的响应，现有方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调。

Result: 实验显示CLAIM在POPE和MME基准上平均提升了13.56%和21.75%的性能。

Conclusion: CLAIM有效缓解了多语言对象幻觉，且中间层的注意力差异在多语言场景中最为显著。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Result: 在多个数据集（MATH500等）上，CyclicReflex优于标准解码和其他方法（如TIP和S1）。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex能有效管理反思令牌的使用，提升模型性能，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

Result: RoE-FND在三个数据集上表现出优于现有方法的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RoE-FND为假新闻检测提供了一种无需训练、适应性强且效果显著的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用开源大语言模型（LLM）从自然语言规范中生成上下文无关计数器文法（CCFG）的方法，结合强化学习优化文法有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范生成有效的通用文法是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。

Method: 通过微调开源LLM进行规范到文法的转换，并应用GRPO强化学习优化文法有效性和通用性。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE方法在文法质量和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLM，文法有效性提升15.92%，测试效果提升12.34%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了文法生成的质量和测试效果，为有限监督下的文法生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于建模临床决策过程的序列化进展，通过预测患者诊断旅程中的下一步骤，显著优于随机基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖孤立的诊断分类，无法捕捉临床轨迹的复杂依赖性，PRISM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PRISM将临床轨迹标记化为事件序列（如诊断测试、实验室结果和诊断），并利用自回归训练目标学习预测下一步骤。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在预测任务中表现优异，生成的序列反映了真实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于序列的医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成语言模型技术在结构化医疗数据中的可行性。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

TL;DR: RedDebate是一种多智能体辩论框架，通过LLM之间的对抗性论证主动识别和减少不安全行为，结合长期记忆模块，显著提升AI安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖昂贵的人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险。RedDebate通过多智能体辩论和自动化红队测试解决这些问题。

Method: RedDebate利用多LLM的对抗性辩论和长期记忆模块，系统性识别不安全盲点并迭代改进响应。

Result: 在HarmBench等基准测试中，辩论使不安全行为减少17.7%，结合长期记忆模块后减少超过23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个完全自动化结合多智能体辩论与红队测试的框架，无需人工干预即可持续提升AI安全性。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SPACE框架，通过编辑共享激活子空间同时提升LLMs的事实性和忠实性，解决了现有方法独立处理幻觉类型导致的性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在实际部署中因事实性和忠实性幻觉问题受限，现有方法独立处理这些问题导致性能权衡。

Method: 通过分析LLMs激活空间动态，发现幻觉类型共享子空间，提出SPACE框架，结合双任务特征建模和混合探测策略（谱聚类与注意力头显著性评分）编辑共享子空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明SPACE方法的优越性。

Conclusion: SPACE为同时提升LLMs的事实性和忠实性提供了统一框架，揭示了共享子空间的潜力。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的无监督领域适应方法，利用LLM的反馈提升ASR模型在领域不匹配情况下的命名实体识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR系统在通用转录任务上表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配方面仍有不足。LLMs因其大规模训练数据在多领域表现更优，因此被用于提升ASR性能。

Method: 通过强化学习方法，利用LLM作为奖励模型对ASR模型的假设进行评分，并以这些评分为奖励信号对ASR模型进行微调。

Result: 该方法在实体词错误率上比传统自训练方法提升了21%。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的强化学习方法显著提升了ASR模型在领域适应和命名实体识别上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCT是一个轻量级框架，扩展了RAG以支持多轮对话和动态工具环境，无需重新训练，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统局限于静态、单轮交互，无法适应动态领域（如医疗和智能家居）的需求。

Method: DCT结合了基于注意力的上下文缓存、LoRA检索和高效上下文压缩，支持动态工具选择和上下文管理。

Result: 实验显示DCT将计划准确性提高14%，幻觉减少37%，且成本显著低于GPT-4。

Conclusion: DCT能够泛化到未见过的工具，适用于广泛的动态环境，具有可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与至关重要，但在NLP领域研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过量化信息缺口来建模好奇心。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模和持久同调分析，构建动态语义网络并提取其拓扑特征（如连通组件、循环、空洞），作为信息缺口的代理变量。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线模型显著提升了好奇心预测的准确性（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与关系提供了新的计算方法，验证了信息缺口理论在NLP中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了C-SEO Bench，首个用于评估跨任务、领域和多参与者的C-SEO方法的基准，发现现有方法效果有限，传统SEO策略更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究C-SEO方法的广泛适用性和多参与者竞争场景下的效果，填补现有评估的局限性。

Method: 设计C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖多种任务、领域和参与者数量，提出新的评估协议。

Result: 当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；多参与者竞争导致收益递减。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有零和性质，传统SEO策略在LLM环境中更具优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的中等规模LLM（如Mistral 7B）通过少量样本上下文微调可以实现多任务处理，但仍落后于专用微调。ManyICL旨在提升性能并解决效率问题。

Method: 提出ManyICL方法，将多样本上下文示例从提示转换为自回归学习的目标，并通过新的训练目标优化长序列处理效率。

Result: 实验表明，ManyICL在分类、摘要、问答等任务上显著优于零/少量样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: ManyICL在多任务处理中表现出色，为LLM的上下文学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制（DAM），通过自适应掩码解决长序列任务中静态稀疏注意力的局限性，提升计算效率且无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏注意力方法使用静态预定义掩码，无法捕捉异构注意力模式，导致长序列任务中的交互和检索性能受限。

Method: 引入动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图级别分配自适应掩码，保留各层和头的异构模式，无需预定义掩码结构。

Result: 该方法与全注意力模型高度对齐，显著减少内存和计算开销，性能损失最小。

Conclusion: DAM为大规模语言模型提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，兼顾效率和检索性能。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Motivation: LLMs在医疗场景中潜力巨大，但体积过大难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: 通过测量神经元重要性进行剪枝，再结合量化技术压缩模型，评估于MedMCQA等医疗基准。

Result: 成功压缩Gemma和LLaMA3模型50%和67%，在Jetson Orin Nano和Raspberry Pi 5上实现高效推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs在医疗领域的边缘部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于实体的RAG方法可能误解或遗漏潜在关键信息，导致检索内容不相关或矛盾，增加幻觉风险并降低生成响应的保真度。

Method: PankRAG采用全局感知的分层查询解析策略和依赖感知重排机制，构建多级解析路径并利用依赖结构优化检索结果。

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，证明了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过结构化推理和依赖感知优化，显著提升了RAG方法的性能，为复杂查询处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Result: 提出了一种基于熵的注意力钳制机制，防止注意力过早集中在早期上下文。

Conclusion: 为多参与方对话和层次化推理提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

### [121] [Enhancing Large Language Models for Mobility Analytics with Semantic Location Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11109)
*Yile Chen,Yicheng Tao,Yue Jiang,Shuai Liu,Han Yu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QT-Mob是一个新颖的框架，通过语义丰富的令牌表示位置和多重微调目标，显著提升了LLM在移动性分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在位置语义表示和移动信号建模方面存在不足，限制了LLM在移动性分析中的应用。

Method: QT-Mob引入位置令牌化模块和互补微调目标，增强LLM对移动模式和位置语义的理解。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob不仅提升了LLM对移动数据的解释能力，还为移动性分析任务提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench评估LLMs在面对用户对立陈述时保持事实一致性的能力，通过构建两种对立提示并记录模型的反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在用户对立陈述下是否坚持事实一致性，而非盲目同意用户。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集采样事实，构建对立提示（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型反应。

Result: 通过分层结果，隔离框架诱导的变异性，衡量模型坚持事实的能力。

Conclusion: AssertBench旨在量化LLMs在面对对立用户断言时保持事实一致性的能力。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Result: 评估显示LLMs在对抗性攻击下表现脆弱，文本操纵会扭曲其审稿结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调需解决对抗性风险，以确保AI增强而非损害学术交流的完整性。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

Motivation: 现有基准测试多为文本、英语中心且局限于医学领域，无法全面评估医疗AI的广泛知识和多模态推理能力。

Method: 构建KokushiMD-10基准，包含11588个真实考试问题，涵盖多个医疗领域，并整合临床图像和专家注释。

Result: 测试了30多个先进LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5和Gemini），结果显示无模型能稳定通过所有领域。

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为评估和推进医疗AI在多语言和多模态任务中的推理能力提供了全面资源，凸显了医疗AI的持续挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标记化方法在材料科学中无法保持结构和语义完整性，导致语义丢失和过度碎片化。

Method: MATTER结合了基于材料知识库训练的MatDetector和重排序方法，优先合并材料概念。

Result: 实验表明，MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别实现了4%和2%的平均性能提升。

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理中的标记化策略至关重要。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct是一个高质量指令数据集，通过两阶段流程提升LLM的基础和聊天能力，显著超越现有开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集局限于狭窄领域，限制了LLM的泛化能力，与专有模型差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 从1亿样本中筛选7.4M高质量基础指令；2) 通过指令选择、进化和过滤合成1.5M高质量聊天指令。

Result: 在多个开源模型上验证，性能显著提升，InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令任务上超越GPT-4-0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct展示了基础和聊天训练的协同效应，为LLM开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

TL;DR: ScIRGen是一个科学问答与检索数据集生成框架，旨在更准确地反映科研人员的信息需求，并创建了一个大规模的科学检索增强生成数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索和问答数据集通常处理简单问题，与真实研究需求不符，因此需要开发更贴合实际需求的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集信息提取方法，采用认知分类法生成高质量问题，并基于LLMs的困惑度变化自动过滤合成答案。

Result: 创建了包含61k问答对的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并评估了现有方法在复杂问题上的表现，发现其推理能力仍有不足。

Conclusion: ScIRGen推动了支持复杂科学信息需求的工具发展，为科学社区提供了更先进的资源。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

TL;DR: 该研究利用基础模型对阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）进行早期检测，通过语音和语言模型分析自发语音，发现基于声学的方法（如ASR生成的嵌入）表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测ADRD对及时干预至关重要，自发语音中的声学和语言标记可作为非侵入性生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，包含1600多名参与者的录音，筛选后分为健康对照组（HC）、轻度认知障碍（MCI）和阿尔茨海默病（AD）。测试多种开源语音和语言模型进行分类。

Result: Whisper-medium语音模型表现最佳（准确率0.731，AUC 0.802），BERT语言模型在文本分类中表现最好（准确率0.662，AUC 0.744）。ASR生成的声学嵌入效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究提出了基于基础模型的基准框架，声学方法（如ASR嵌入）在ADRD早期检测中具有可扩展、非侵入和成本效益高的潜力。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失的方法，以更准确地利用原始模型的预测信息，从而提升LLM的生成能力。同时，专注于剪枝MLP模块以显著压缩模型而不明显降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能强大，但其部署成本高昂。现有基于梯度的剪枝方法因使用one-hot标签而忽略了其他词的预测信息，导致生成能力下降。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，充分利用原始模型的预测信息；专注于剪枝MLP模块以减少参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，并在1B规模开源LLMs中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自蒸馏损失和MLP模块剪枝，有效压缩LLM且保持性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

TL;DR: SUTA-LM是一种结合语言模型重评分的测试时自适应方法，解决了传统方法中TTA与语言模型干扰的问题，并在18个ASR数据集上表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管端到端ASR取得进展，但实际领域不匹配仍导致性能下降。TTA旨在通过推理时调整模型来缓解此问题，但传统方法中TTA与语言模型重评分的结合存在干扰问题。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，基于熵最小化的TTA方法，结合语言模型重评分。通过自动步长选择机制控制适应过程，并利用声学和语言信息优化输出。

Result: 在18个多样化的ASR数据集上，SUTA-LM表现出广泛的领域适应性。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM有效解决了TTA与语言模型结合的挑战，为领域不匹配问题提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术规模化实施，威胁安全，需有效防御手段。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架注入对抗性扰动，并设计EchoGuard利用自然失真干扰ASR。

Result: 39人用户研究表明，EchoGuard在ASR干扰和人类体验上表现最佳。

Conclusion: EchoGuard提供了一种实用且高效的防御方案，平衡了安全性和用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和优越性能，证明语音作为指令模态的潜力。

Conclusion: GUIRoboTron-Speech展示了语音驱动GUI代理的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and

### [135] [Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11128)
*Andrew Keenan Richardson,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Sean Moss,Vincent Wang-Mascianica,Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，随着语言模型能力的提升，其错误模式逐渐趋近于人类推理中的常见谬误，而非达到规范性理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否随着能力的提升而趋近于人类推理模式，尤其是错误模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具包生成逻辑推理问题，评估38个语言模型在383个任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，错误答案中与ETR预测的人类谬误相符的比例增加（ρ=0.360, p=0.0265），但逻辑正确性与模型能力无关。

Conclusion: 语言模型的错误模式趋近于人类推理的偏见和局限性，挑战了模型规模提升自然实现规范性理性的观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医疗应用中的幻觉问题，确保其安全性和可靠性。

Method: CHECK框架整合结构化临床数据库和信息理论分类器，检测事实和推理幻觉。

Result: 将LLama3.3-70B-Instruct的幻觉率从31%降至0.3%，并在多个医疗基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: CHECK为医疗等高风险领域提供了一种可扩展的安全LLM部署方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自优化框架，利用无标签数据集提升ASR性能，通过伪标签和TTS系统实现闭环优化，显著降低了错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升的挑战，避免依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 利用现有ASR模型生成伪标签，训练高保真TTS系统，合成语音-文本对并反馈至ASR系统，形成闭环优化。

Result: 在台湾普通话任务中，错误率降低20%（普通话）和50%（中英混合），优于Whisper模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源或领域特定ASR提供了一种高效的自优化方法，优于传统伪标签自蒸馏方法。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究涌现现象在复杂系统中的作用，并探讨LLM是否表现出涌现能力及其智能特性。

Method: 通过回顾涌现的量化方法，分析LLM的涌现能力和智能表现。

Result: 论文总结了LLM可能具备的涌现能力，并讨论了其是否构成涌现智能。

Conclusion: LLM展现出一定的涌现能力，但其是否达到涌现智能仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了开源和专有大型语言模型（LLMs）在从电子健康记录（EHR）中提取药物信息并分类其状态的能力，发现GPT-4o在零样本设置下表现最佳，开源模型如Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct也表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别EHR中的药物停用信息对患者安全至关重要，但此类信息常隐藏在非结构化笔记中，需要高效且可扩展的自动提取方法。

Method: 研究收集了三个EHR数据集，评估了12种LLMs，并探索了多种提示策略，比较了药物提取、状态分类及其联合任务的性能。

Result: GPT-4o在零样本设置下表现最佳（药物提取F1=94.0%，停用分类F1=78.1%，联合任务F1=72.7%），开源模型紧随其后。医学专用LLMs表现不如通用领域模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在EHR药物信息提取和停用分类中潜力巨大，开源模型可替代专有系统，少量样本学习能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟全球南方研究机构因计算资源昂贵而受限的条件，验证小模型在共享任务中的可行性。

Method: 使用参数少于1B的小模型参与BEA 2025共享任务，限制计算资源需求。

Result: 在五个赛道中，与优胜者的$exact\ F_1$分数差距为6.46至13.13，表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 小模型（<1B参数）在低预算GPU或无GPU设备上仍能胜任任务，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏见方法无法利用多语言表示的共享语义空间，限制了跨语言偏见迁移的效果。

Method: 提出IMSAE，通过迭代SVD截断在多语言中识别和缓解联合偏见子空间。

Result: 在八种语言和五种人口统计维度上验证了IMSAE的有效性，尤其在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: IMSAE在多语言去偏见任务中优于传统方法，同时保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 时间表格推理是LLMs的重要挑战，现有提示方法效果差异大且缺乏系统性研究，需探索最优方法。

Method: 研究多种提示技术在不同表格类型中的表现，提出自适应框架SEAR，动态调整提示策略并整合结构化推理。

Result: SEAR在所有表格类型中表现最优，表格结构重构能进一步提升推理效果。

Conclusion: SEAR框架显著提升LLMs的表格推理能力，统一表格表示有助于模型表现。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过学习专用继续思考标记（如“<|continue-thinking|>”）来扩展语言模型推理步骤的效果，相比固定标记方法（如“Wait”），学习标记在数学基准测试中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过学习专用标记（而非固定标记）来触发更长的推理步骤，从而提升语言模型性能。

Method: 在蒸馏版DeepSeek-R1中引入单一学习标记“<|continue-thinking|>”，仅通过强化学习训练其嵌入，同时冻结模型权重。

Result: 学习标记在GSM8K等数学基准测试中显著优于基线模型和固定标记方法（如4.2% vs 1.3%的绝对提升）。

Conclusion: 学习专用继续思考标记是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，能显著提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习在多个机器学习领域表现出提升训练效率和泛化能力的潜力，但在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未充分探索，因此本文进行了系统性研究。

Method: 实验了多种课程学习设置，包括基础课程学习、基于步调的采样和交错课程，并基于六种难度指标（涵盖语言学和信息论视角）进行指导。

Result: 课程学习在早期和中期训练阶段显著提升收敛速度，作为预热策略时可持续带来高达3.5%的性能提升。压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性被证明是有效的难度信号。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据排序在大规模预训练中的重要性，并为实际训练场景下高效、数据节约的模型开发提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Avey的新架构，旨在解决Transformer在处理长序列时的局限性，同时避免RNN的并行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在固定上下文窗口和二次复杂度的问题，而RNN虽然能线性扩展序列长度，但并行性受限。因此，需要一种新架构来解决这些问题。

Method: Avey由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，能够动态识别并处理序列中最相关的标记，从而解耦序列长度与上下文宽度。

Result: 实验表明，Avey在短范围NLP任务中表现与Transformer相当，同时在捕捉长距离依赖方面表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey是一种突破性的架构，能够有效处理任意长度的序列，同时兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Result: 模型困惑度与模型拟合度仍呈正相关，表明这一趋势可推广到神经测量。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理的预测能力具有普遍性，适用于多种测量方式。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种鲁棒、可解释且理论支持的关系抽取解决方案。

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test
sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and
theoretically grounded methodology.

### [151] [Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling for Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11389)
*Karanpartap Singh,Neil Band,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGLS是一种通过逐步增加模型层数和数据难度来提升预训练效率的框架，在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知发展的启发，希望通过同步模型增长和数据难度提升来优化预训练效率。

Method: 采用Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling（CGLS），逐步增加模型层数并配合数据难度提升，从简单数据过渡到复杂数据。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优异，提升了泛化和零样本性能。

Conclusion: CGLS通过渐进式堆叠策略，显著提升了知识密集型和推理任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出Chelsea框架，通过在线KV缓存聚类减少内存使用和计算开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLMs的KV缓存需求高，现有方法效率低或信息丢失严重。

Method: 提出Chunked Soft Matching，分块聚类并合并KV缓存，理论分析计算复杂度和最优分区策略。

Result: 实验显示内存使用减少80%，解码速度提升3.19倍，延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea高效且实用，适用于长上下文LLMs的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR是一种改进的强化学习方法，通过引入代理指导机制，提升了在复杂代理环境中的训练效果，显著提高了任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中效果不佳，因为奖励稀疏导致训练困难。Agent-RLVR旨在通过模拟人类教学方式解决这一问题。

Method: Agent-RLVR通过代理指导机制（如策略计划和动态反馈）引导代理完成任务，并结合RLVR进行策略更新。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified上，Agent-RLVR将Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1性能从9.4%提升至22.4%，进一步优化后达到27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR为复杂环境中的代理训练提供了有效方法，扩展了RLVR的应用范围。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效的韩语语法纠错系统，填补现有大语言模型在韩语GEC任务中的不足。

Method: 微调NLLB模型，使用特殊语言标记区分原始和纠正句子，并通过BLEU和LLM评估方法进行测试。

Result: KoGEC在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3，尤其在多种错误类型上更均衡。

Conclusion: KoGEC展示了任务特定模型在专业NLP任务中的潜力，并提供了新的评估方法。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AbsenceBench，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在检测缺失信息方面的能力，发现即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet表现不佳，揭示了Transformer注意力机制的根本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在长文本中定位特定信息（如NIAH测试）表现出色，但在识别明显缺失信息时仍存在困难，因此需要研究其局限性。

Method: 通过AbsenceBench测试模型在三个领域（数字序列、诗歌、GitHub拉取请求）中检测缺失信息的能力，对比原始和编辑后的文本。

Result: 实验显示，即使先进模型Claude-3.7-Sonnet的F1分数仅为69.6%，表明模型在检测缺失信息方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: Transformer注意力机制难以处理文档中的“空白”，因为缺失信息无法对应具体的键值，揭示了模型在特定任务中的根本限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

Result: 提出了一个针对机器翻译系统开发者的平台设计方案，并讨论了其评估挑战及在自然语言处理研究中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该平台设计为低资源语言机器翻译系统的评估提供了可行解决方案，并具有更广泛的自然语言处理研究应用潜力。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Conclusion: Med-PRM不仅性能卓越，还能以即插即用方式与其他模型集成，首次实现小规模模型在MedQA上超过80%的准确率。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural

Motivation: 探究BERT的语义任务表现是否反映真正的概念能力，而非表面统计关联。

Method: 分析BERT内部表示，比较预训练和微调后[CLS]标记嵌入的关系分类性能。

Result: 预训练BERT具有潜在关系信号，但仅微调后概念对才按关系类型组织。

Conclusion: 行为表现不代表结构化概念理解，但模型可通过适当训练获得关系抽象的归纳偏差。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理方面取得进展，但其处理长上下文的能力受限于注意力计算的二次复杂性和线性增长的内存占用。现有压缩技术常导致性能下降，且不适用于训练后优化。

Method: 采用LRSA方法，结合LagKV压缩技术，通过分块预填充选择最相关的键值对，聚焦于关键历史上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答微调任务中取得更好效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法以低计算开销和无额外参数的方式，有效解决了长上下文处理的性能与效率问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Conclusion: 端到端方法在多模态对话系统中具有潜力，参数共享策略能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

Motivation: 探讨场景上下文如何影响人类对同一抽象形状的不同概念化方式，并验证多模态LLM是否能模拟这种人类行为。

Method: 构建SceneGram数据集，收集人类在不同场景下对抽象形状的命名，并分析多模态LLM的命名表现。

Result: 人类对同一形状的概念化因场景而异，而多模态LLM未能表现出类似的丰富性和变异性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文显著影响人类概念化，而现有多模态LLM在此方面仍有不足。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to

reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

*Pietro Ferrazzi,Alberto Lavelli,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 为了解决CRF数据集稀缺问题，研究者提出将信息提取任务的数据集转换为结构化CRF，并开发了一种半自动转换方法，应用于E3C数据集，生成了高质量的CRF槽填充数据集。实验显示，槽填充任务对大型语言模型仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了基于临床笔记的CRF槽填充系统的发展。

Method: 提出一种半自动转换方法，将信息提取任务的数据集转换为结构化CRF，并以E3C数据集为例进行应用。

Result: 生成的CRF数据集在槽填充任务中表现一般，大型语言模型的零样本性能为意大利语59.7%、英语67.3%，开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: CRF槽填充任务对现有模型仍具挑战性，研究提供了高质量数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

*Alicja Dobrzeniecka,Antske Fokkens,Pia Sommerauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amnesic probing用于分析模型行为中特定语言信息的影响，通过移除目标信息并观察性能变化。INLP方法存在随机修改问题，而MP和LEACE能更精准地移除信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除模型中的特定信息以分析其行为，避免现有方法（如INLP）的随机修改问题。

Method: 提出Mean Projection (MP)和LEACE两种替代方法，用于更精准地移除目标信息。

Result: MP和LEACE能更有效地移除目标信息，提升Amnesic Probing的行为解释能力。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE是INLP的有效替代方法，能更精准地移除信息，为模型行为分析提供更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT)框架，挑战静态偏好的假设，通过动态调整语言模型行为以适应人类可解释的指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI对齐模型（如DPO）假设偏好是静态单一的，限制了适应性。CPT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CPT利用基于结构化细粒度规则生成的合成偏好数据，通过微调使模型能根据系统提示动态调整输出。

Result: 实验表明，CPT能实现细粒度控制，并建模更复杂、上下文相关的人类反馈。

Conclusion: CPT为语言模型提供了动态适应偏好的能力，无需重新训练，增强了灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at
https://github.com/vicgalle/configurable-preference-tuning

### [171] [The Cambrian Explosion of Mixed-Precision Matrix Multiplication for Quantized Deep Learning Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11728)
*Héctor Martínez,Adrián Castelló,Francisco D. Igual,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习（DL）中从传统64位浮点计算转向低精度格式（如FP16、BF16等）的趋势，并提出了一种适应混合精度整数（MIP）算术的高性能矩阵乘法（gemm）优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DL对计算效率和资源利用的需求增加，传统的高精度浮点计算逐渐被低精度和混合精度计算取代，硬件架构也随之演进。然而，现有的gemm优化方法未能充分利用现代ISA的混合精度能力。

Method: 论文提出了新颖的微内核设计和数据布局策略，以更好地利用现代ISA（如x86_64、ARM和RISC-V）的混合精度整数算术能力。

Result: 实验表明，混合精度整数算术在三种代表性CPU架构上比浮点实现带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 论文标志着矩阵乘法优化的新时代，即由DL推理需求驱动的混合精度优化，称之为矩阵乘法的“寒武纪时期”。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART通过自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought推理，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理计算开销大，限制了在延迟敏感应用中的部署。

Method: DART引入两条训练路径：CoT路径和ST路径，后者通过轻量级REM模块对齐隐藏状态，直接生成答案。

Result: DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: DART是高效推理的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepResearch Bench是一个用于评估基于LLM的深度研究代理（DRA）能力的基准测试，包含100个博士级研究任务，并提出两种评估方法以对齐人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏系统性评估DRA能力的基准，阻碍了其发展。

Method: 提出两种方法：基于参考的自适应标准评估报告质量，以及评估信息检索和引用的框架。

Result: 开源了DeepResearch Bench和关键评估框架，以推动LLM代理的实用化。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench填补了DRA评估的空白，为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文建模中因固定上下文窗口而受限，长度泛化是关键挑战。传统方法关注输入特征，本文转向输出分布，探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 通过合成任务案例研究，提出长短期对齐概念，并开发Long-Short Misalignment指标。基于此设计正则化项，促进训练中的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，长短期对齐与长度泛化性能强相关，提出的正则化方法显著提升了模型表现。

Conclusion: 研究为长上下文建模提供了新视角，通过关注输出分布和长短期对齐，实现了更有效的长度泛化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了零样本角色提示是否能准确预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为和政策立场，发现其预测效果较好（加权F1分数约0.793）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中表现出进步左倾偏见，研究希望通过角色提示模拟不同群体的政治立场。

Method: 使用零样本角色提示，结合有限信息预测个体投票决策和群体政策立场，并评估其对反事实论点、不同提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 模型能较好地模拟欧洲议会议员的投票行为（加权F1分数约0.793），并提供了相关数据集和代码。

Conclusion: 零样本角色提示能有效预测政治行为，为模拟群体政治立场提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管任务对人类来说简单，但对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的语用能力是一个重要测试。

Method: 通过简单抽象的视觉刺激（如色块和色格）设计指代消解任务。

Result: 结果表明，即使是基础的语用能力（如颜色描述的上下文依赖解释），对当前最先进的MLLMs仍构成挑战。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基础语用能力方面仍需改进。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

*Yi-Pei Chen,Noriki Nishida,Hideki Nakayama,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PPA的两阶段框架，用于解决多轮对话中保持长期一致性和生成个性化多样化回复的挑战。PPA通过先生成通用回复，再检索相关人物记忆并调整回复，显著提升了对话的一致性、多样性和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮对话中表现优异，但在多轮对话中难以保持人物一致性和对话连贯性。现有方法通常在生成回复前检索人物信息，限制了多样性和个性化。

Method: PPA采用两阶段框架：1）仅基于对话上下文生成通用回复；2）以回复为查询检索相关人物记忆；3）调整回复以符合人物特性。

Result: 实验表明，PPA在多轮对话数据中显著优于现有方法，在一致性、多样性和人物相关性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Motivation: 随着上下文长度增加，大语言模型的KV缓存内存需求成为瓶颈，现有压缩方法牺牲准确性或引入计算开销。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，将长上下文不敏感的维度投影到正交傅里叶基上，并用固定长度的频谱系数近似其时间演化。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上评估，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH任务上实现了最佳的长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: FourierAttention通过FlashFourierAttention内核优化内存，实现了高效部署且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Conclusion: GeistBERT为德语NLP社区提供了高性能模型，并开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open

classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在理想条件下整合外部反馈的能力，以揭示其自我改进的局限性。

Method: 设计实验环境，通过反馈生成器提供近乎完整的真实答案反馈，并评估LLMs在数学推理、知识推理等多任务中的表现。

Result: 即使条件理想，LLMs仍表现出对反馈的抵抗（反馈摩擦），改进策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLMs的显著限制，未来研究需进一步探索其成因和解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）易受对抗攻击，现有防御方法难以泛化到不同类型的攻击。

Method: 将模型防御问题转化为对比表示学习问题，使用三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘来区分良性表示和有害表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有基于表示工程的防御方法，提高了对输入级和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性，且不影响标准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的CRL框架为LLM对抗攻击防御提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.
