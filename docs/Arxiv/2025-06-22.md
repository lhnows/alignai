### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, which is underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs and evaluates multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clinical NLP resources focused on elderly patients and to provide a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods.

Method: The authors developed a manually annotated corpus including 14 clinically significant AEs with contextual attributes. They evaluated multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation.

Result: Transformer-based models performed well on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), but performance dropped significantly for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675). Challenges remain in detecting rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level scores, there are still significant challenges in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. The dataset serves as a robust benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) combines constrained and unconstrained decoding to improve the quality of structured NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many recent approaches use an autoregressive language model to map unstructured input text to output text representing structured objects, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time.

Method: BoostCD decodes from the base model twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. Then a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction.

Result: BoostCD outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

Conclusion: BoostCD is a powerful method for structured NLP tasks that improves the quality of output during constrained decoding.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrEst, a weakly supervised framework to assess context document credibility in LLMs without manual annotations. It proposes two integration strategies and shows significant performance improvements in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of varying credibility in context documents used by LLMs, which can lead to unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst is grounded in the idea that credible documents have higher semantic coherence with other credible documents. It uses inter-document agreement for automated credibility estimation and proposes black-box and white-box integration strategies for LLM inference.

Result: CrEst outperforms strong baselines across three model architectures and five datasets, achieving up to 26.86% improvement in accuracy and 3.49% increase in F1 score. It also maintains robust performance under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: CrEst provides an effective solution to incorporate document credibility into LLM inference, enhancing performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 创建了一个名为MDBench的新数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在多文档推理任务中的表现。通过新颖的合成生成过程，可控且高效地生成具有挑战性的文档集和相应的问答示例。实验表明，MDBench对所有方法都构成了重大挑战，并允许进行有针对性的分析和快速适应新的挑战及未来的模型改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理长上下文输入方面表现出色，但在多文档推理领域的基准测试却很少。此外，由于标注长输入的成本高昂，为多文档设置创建基准一直是个难题。因此，需要一个新的基准来严格检验模型在这种设置下的行为。

Method: 引入了MDBench数据集，通过一种新颖的合成生成过程创建。该技术基于浓缩的结构化种子知识，通过LLM辅助编辑对其进行修改，以诱导特定于多文档的推理挑战。然后将这种结构化知识转换为自然文本形式，生成文档集和相应的问答示例。

Result: 流行的大型语言模型和提示技术在MDBench上面临重大挑战，即使是在相对较短的文档集上。知识引导的生成技术能够轻松执行针对多文档特定推理能力的分析，并能快速适应新挑战和未来的模型改进。

Conclusion: MDBench提供了一个强大的基准，用于评估大型语言模型在多文档推理任务中的表现。其合成生成过程使得可控和高效地生成具有挑战性的文档集和问答示例成为可能，有助于深入分析模型的能力并推动未来的研究进展。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting diabetes using structured numerical data, comparing open-source and proprietary LLMs with traditional machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in medical prediction tasks, specifically diabetes prediction, using structured numerical data from Pima Indian Diabetes Database.

Method: Tested six LLMs (four open-source and two proprietary) using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. Compared their performance with three traditional ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics.

Result: Proprietary LLMs outperformed open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B also surpassed traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Conclusion: LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks but require further research on prompt engineering and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of generating reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly without altering the model's weights.

Method: Introducing a special memory token whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly.

Result: Evaluated across English and Spanish datasets, sequences up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructed all tested sequences.

Conclusion: This phenomenon highlights an interesting capability of LLMs and suggests potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过自然语言处理技术，研究者分析了美国国家暴力死亡报告系统中的数据，开发了高质量分类器来识别社会孤立和孤独感，并发现男性、同性恋及离异人士更可能遭受长期社会孤立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会孤立和孤独感近年来不断上升，对自杀率有显著影响。然而，美国国家暴力死亡报告系统并未记录这些变量，因此需要新的方法来识别这些因素。

Method: 利用主题建模生成词典开发和监督学习分类器，通过自然语言处理技术分析执法和法医检查员的叙述，以识别社会孤立和孤独感。

Result: 开发的分类器质量高（平均F1：0.86，准确率：0.82），在超过30万份自杀案例中识别出1,198例提到慢性社会孤立的情况，并发现了多个显著预测因素。

Conclusion: 该方法可以改进美国社会孤立和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation. It provides better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics and aligns well with the rewards needed for GRPO. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT leads to responses more aligned with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging due to difficulty in defining clear distinctions between good and bad outputs, missing key aspects in existing methods, and bias from pretraining data.

Method: Propose PrefBERT, a scoring model trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality. It evaluates open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guides its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs.

Result: PrefBERT offers better semantic reward feedback than ROUGE-L and BERTScore. It remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Using PrefBERT as the reward signal yields responses better aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: PrefBERT is effective in evaluating open-ended long-form generation and guiding training with better alignment to human preferences compared to traditional metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要具备事后移除特定知识的能力，即“遗忘”能力。本文研究了学习时间选择对遗忘事实知识有效性的影响，发现使用同义改写描述和从文本块中遗忘单个知识点具有挑战性，表明学习时的知识编码可能在实现可靠的后验遗忘中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实世界中的应用日益广泛，隐私法规、纠正过时或有害内容等原因使得事后移除特定知识的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 通过实验探讨学习过程中知识编码的选择如何影响事后遗忘事实知识的有效性。

Result: 1) 使用同义改写描述可以提高遗忘性能；2) 从一段文本中遗忘单个知识点具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码可能在实现可靠的后验遗忘中起着核心作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) with two reasoning processes and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to enhance dialogue discourse parsing, achieving better performance on STAC and Molweni datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue discourse parsing faces challenges due to ambiguities introduced by linguistic features like omission and idiom.

Method: Propose DCM with clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning, and CPO to optimize DCM's performance.

Result: Effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms SOTA baselines on STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: The approach improves dialogue discourse parsing by addressing ambiguities through DCM and CPO.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

### [11] [CKD-EHR:Clinical Knowledge Distillation for Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15118)
*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CKD-EHR framework which uses knowledge distillation techniques to improve disease risk prediction based on EHR. It fine-tunes Qwen2.5-7B as the teacher model and transfers the knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model, achieving significant performance improvements on MIMIC-III dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models have insufficient medical knowledge representation and low efficiency in clinical deployment.

Method: CKD-EHR framework applies knowledge distillation techniques. The large language model Qwen2.5-7B is fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model, generating interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism, then transferring the distilled knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model.

Result: On the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model with 9% increase in diagnostic accuracy, 27% improvement in F1-score, and 22.2 times inference speedup.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将开放域对话生成分解为多响应生成和基于偏好的选择两个任务，并引入o2mDial语料库，提出新的学习策略和评估指标，从而在不牺牲连贯性的情况下显著提高小规模LLM的响应多样性与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前研究表明建模开放域对话的一对多特性可以提升响应多样性，但大多数现代基于LLM的对话代理并未明确利用这一特性。

Method: 将开放域对话生成分为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS）两个任务；创建了专门捕捉一对多特性的对话语料库o2mDial；提出了新的上下文学习和指令调优策略及针对MRG的新评估指标，以及用于PS的模型驱动方法。

Result: 实证结果表明，在较小的LLM上应用所提出的两阶段框架，可以在保持上下文连贯性的同时增强响应多样性，并使响应质量最高提升90%，接近较大模型的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的两阶段框架来增强小型LLM在开放域对话中的表现，通过利用一对多特性提高了响应质量和多样性。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer which reduces token fertility by 10% without affecting model performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a more efficient tokenizer for the Korean language that reduces token fertility without compromising model performance.

Method: The approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method aligned with Korean linguistic structure, creates a seed vocabulary of linguistically relevant tokens, and employs a branching entropy-based selection algorithm to increase average token length.

Result: Thunder-Tok reduces token fertility by approximately 10%, leading to a 10% reduction in the number of tokens and a 10% improvement in inference speed compared to BPE, all while maintaining performance on various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach used in Thunder-Tok is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [14] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects, finding that long-term memory is supported by sparse channels, short-term memory governed by delta-modulated recurrence, and memory allocation modulated by semantic regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models, using behavioral tools such as primacy and recency effects.

Method: Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture and observing the U-shaped accuracy profile. Identifying mechanisms related to long-term memory, short-term memory, and memory allocation modulation.

Result: Discovered three key mechanisms: persistent encoding of early input tokens for long-term memory, exponential decay-weighted recent inputs for short-term memory, and dynamic modulation of memory allocation based on semantic regularity.

Conclusion: These findings were validated via targeted ablations and input perturbations on large-scale Mamba-based language models.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

*Andrea Cadeddu,Alessandro Chessa,Vincenzo De Leo,Gianni Fenu,Enrico Motta,Francesco Osborne,Diego Reforgiato Recupero,Angelo Salatino,Luca Secchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of various proprietary and open-source large language models (LLMs) for a single-label, multi-class text classification task related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also evaluates different learning techniques including Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning. The study finds that smaller models optimized via prompt engineering can perform as well as larger models such as OpenAI's GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the challenge of tracking progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models are needed to automate the analysis of vast amounts of text from various sources.

Method: The method involves analyzing various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on SDGs. It also evaluates task adaptation techniques including Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: The results show that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform comparably to larger models like OpenAI's GPT.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that with proper optimization techniques, smaller models can be effective in text classification tasks related to SDGs.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have shown cross-domain generalization capabilities. The paper hypothesizes that this arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes, proposing ProtoReasoning framework which enhances LLMs' reasoning ability through scalable and verifiable prototypical representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of cross-domain generalization capabilities in Large Reasoning Models trained with Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, hypothesizing that it arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes.

Method: ProtoReasoning framework features an automated prototype construction pipeline, a comprehensive verification system, and scalability within prototype space using Prolog for logical reasoning and PDDL for planning.

Result: ProtoReasoning shows improvements over baseline models: 4.7% on logical reasoning, 6.3% on planning tasks, 4.0% on general reasoning, and 1.0% on mathematics. Ablation studies confirm enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations.

Conclusion: The hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models is validated.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval是一种新的开放式问题回答评估方法，通过区分事实性和非事实性问题并采用不同的评估策略，提高与人工标注的一致性和结果的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM评估方法在处理开放式问题时存在不足：传统度量难以捕捉语义相似性，当前基于LLM的方法缺乏直观可解释性，且未能区分事实性和非事实性问题。

Method: 提出MinosEval方法，首先区分开放式问题为事实性或非事实性问题，然后分别应用不同的评估策略：对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放式QA数据集（包括自建数据集）上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更一致，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval为开放式问题回答提供了一种更精细和可解释的自动评估方法，有效解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties using Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well current language technologies can handle linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish languages.

Method: Using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) for crosslingual and in-context learning experiments, introducing a novel manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish along with their respective variants.

Result: There is a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, particularly in Basque. Encoder-only models struggle more with Western Basque, aligning with linguistic theory that peripheral dialects are more distant from the standard.

Conclusion: Error analysis suggests that the decline in performance is due to linguistic variation itself rather than lexical overlap.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Result: Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). DeepSeek model with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% on the C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B's F1 value.

Conclusion: The Graph RAG framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to

synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new de-identification framework, Thunder-DeID, for court judgments in South Korea is proposed, featuring a Korean legal dataset, systematic PII categorization, and a DNN-based pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current de-identification process of court judgments in South Korea is insufficient for handling large-scale data while meeting strict legal requirements. Legal definitions of personal identifiers are vague, making it hard to apply technical solutions effectively.

Method: Construct the first Korean legal dataset with annotated judgments and entity mentions, introduce a systematic PII categorization, and develop an end-to-end DNN-based de-identification pipeline called Thunder-DeID.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID provides an effective solution to balance open access to justice and personal data protection by improving the de-identification process of court judgments.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

TL;DR: This paper surveys the application of LLMs in clinical trial recruitment, focusing on the task of trial-patient matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current methods for matching patients with clinical trials and to explore how LLMs can be better utilized in this critical domain.

Method: The authors conduct a survey analyzing existing benchmarks, approaches, and evaluation frameworks for LLM-based solutions in clinical trial recruitment.

Result: Identifies challenges in adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and highlights promising future directions.

Conclusion: LLMs have great potential to improve trial-patient matching but require more robust evaluation benchmarks and open models to fully realize their capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管许多关于语言识别模型的研究都集中在收集多样化的训练数据以提高性能，但低资源语言的表现仍然较差，尤其是在单领域数据（如圣经）中。为了解决这些类别不平衡和偏差问题，需要一种新方法来改善低资源语言的领域外数据的识别性能。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的监督对比学习(SCL)方法，通过学习低资源语言的领域不变表示来解决类别不平衡和偏差问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低资源语言的领域外数据上提高了3.2%的语言识别性能，证明了其在增强语言识别模型方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的监督对比学习方法能够有效提高低资源语言在领域外数据上的语言识别性能，为改善多语言LLM预训练语料库的语言识别步骤提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为DeVisE的行为测试框架，用于评估大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的表现。通过构建包含真实和合成数据的ICU出院记录数据集，研究了模型对人口统计学和生命体征属性变化的敏感性及推理能力。结果表明，零样本模型表现出更连贯的反事实推理模式，而微调模型则更为稳定但对临床有意义的变化反应较少。同时发现人口统计因素会微妙但一致地影响输出，强调了公平性评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的评估方法往往无法区分真实的医学推理与表面模式，因此需要一个更精细的评估框架来探测模型的临床理解能力。

Method: 引入了DeVisE框架，使用MIMIC-IV数据集构建ICU出院记录，生成真实和合成版本的数据，并通过单变量反事实控制人口统计学和生命体征属性。然后评估五种不同类型的大型语言模型在零样本和微调设置下的表现，分别从输入级敏感性和下游推理两个方面进行分析。

Result: 零样本模型表现出更连贯的反事实推理模式，而微调模型虽然更稳定但对临床有意义的变化反应较少。此外，人口统计因素会对模型输出产生微妙但持续的影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试有助于揭示临床大型语言模型的推理策略，并为设计更安全、更透明的医疗AI系统提供信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Conclusion: COSMMIC数据集填补了印度语言资源的空白，推动了NLP研究的发展，促进了包容性。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

### [27] [Targeted Lexical Injection: Unlocking Latent Cross-Lingual Alignment in Lugha-Llama via Early-Layer LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15415)
*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often underperform in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Swahili due to data scarcity and underrepresentation. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning approach using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning, to enhance lexical alignment for LRLs. Experiments show TLI significantly improves lexical alignment in both trained and unseen Swahili-English word pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of poor performance of LLMs in low-resource languages, particularly Swahili, due to insufficient data and lack of cross-lingual lexical alignment.

Method: The method involves identifying an early layer in the model with strong lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs, then using Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune the model's embeddings from this layer.

Result: TLI significantly improved lexical alignment for both trained (increased average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113) and unseen word pairs (from 0.3143 to 0.4033), with statistically significant improvements.

Conclusion: Targeted Lexical Injection enhances the ability of LLMs to preserve and propagate their inherent cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Method: Propose a fine-grained evaluation framework categorizing predictions into four types, introduce Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) for uncertainty quantification, and Context-Aware Cropping for improving model performance without additional training.

Result: The framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework and techniques offer ways to better understand and improve the reliability of MLLMs in GUI interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems, demonstrating significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

*Xinnuo Xu,Rachel Lawrence,Kshitij Dubey,Atharva Pandey,Risa Ueno,Fabian Falck,Aditya V. Nori,Rahul Sharma,Amit Sharma,Javier Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks, but it's unclear if this is due to true reasoning or statistical recall. This paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework that characterizes a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs and generates problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. The framework demonstrates reductions in model performance when queried with problem variations, indicating reliance on statistical recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the high accuracy of LLMs on reasoning benchmarks is due to true reasoning or statistical recall of the training set.

Method: RE-IMAGINE, a framework that uses the ladder of causation to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs and an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy.

Result: Observes reductions in performance when LLMs are queried with problem variations, indicating reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: The assessments indicate that LLMs rely on statistical recall for past performance and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理时通常补充外部知识以提供不在其参数中编码的信息或减少幻觉。本文提出了一种后训练监督方法CINGS，通过在训练时将相关上下文附加到响应前，仅在响应标记上计算损失并屏蔽上下文，使模型生成更基于外部上下文的响应。实验表明，CINGS在文本和视觉领域都表现出更强的基于上下文的生成能力，且不会降低整体下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在推理时简单地附加上下文并不能确保生成的内容基于该上下文，但需要一种方法来确保LLMs能够更好地利用外部知识生成响应。

Method: 提出了一种称为Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS)的后训练监督方法，其中模型在训练时使用相关上下文前置的响应进行训练，但在计算损失时仅考虑响应标记并屏蔽上下文。

Result: CINGS在11个信息检索数据集上的文本领域和4个基准上的视觉-语言领域均表现出色，减少了幻觉并保持了事实一致性，同时没有降低整体下游性能。

Conclusion: CINGS是一种有效的后训练监督方法，可以增强LLMs在文本和视觉领域的基于上下文的生成能力，诱导模型更多地依赖外部上下文。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

TL;DR: SPARE is a new framework for single-pass process annotation that enhances multi-step reasoning in LLMs, showing effectiveness across domains and improved efficiency compared to tree search-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Introduced SPARE, which enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution with explicit reasoning for evaluation.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance in fine-tuning models and training reward models, achieves competitive performance on mathematical datasets, and offers 2.6 times greater efficiency than tree search-based automatic annotation.

Conclusion: SPARE effectively facilitates process supervision across various domains and provides a more efficient alternative to existing methods, with public release of codebase and trained model to support further research.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmoBi, a framework for hyperbole and metaphor detection guided by emotion analysis. It outperforms baselines with significant F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbole and metaphor detection is crucial but challenging in NLP due to semantic obscurity and expressive diversity. Existing methods focus on superficial text features, ignoring associations and implicit emotion effects.

Method: Proposes EmoBi framework with three modules: emotion analysis module mines connotations, domain mapping module identifies domains, and bidirectional dynamic interaction module promotes mutual understanding. A verification mechanism ensures accuracy and reliability.

Result: Experiments show EmoBi surpasses all baseline methods on four datasets, achieving 28.1% higher F1 score for hyperbole detection on TroFi and 23.1% for metaphor detection on HYPO-L compared to current SoTA.

Conclusion: EmoBi effectively advances hyperbole and metaphor detection, showcasing its potential in this field.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

TL;DR: 生成有根据且可信赖的回复对于大语言模型来说仍然是一个关键挑战。本文探讨了如何通过强化学习和内部推理来增强LLM中的接地效果，提出了一种名为GRPO的方法，并通过多阶段训练提高了模型性能。研究结果表明，结合指令微调和GRPO可以显著提升模型在长篇问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于检索的生成（RAG）和基于引用的接地方法具有潜力，但现有的指令微调模型在处理简单场景时仍存在诸多问题，如遗漏明确答案、错误引用或拒绝提供证据支持的回答。因此，需要探索新的方法来改善LLM的接地效果。

Method: 使用GRPO方法对模型进行训练，利用可验证的结果驱动奖励来优化回答正确性、引用充分性和拒绝质量。采用两阶段训练策略：首先优化回答和引用行为，然后优化拒绝行为。此外，通过GPT-4蒸馏重新审视指令微调，并将其与GRPO结合以提高长篇问答任务的表现。

Result: 经过实验验证，推理增强模型在处理无法回答的问题和生成引用充分的回答方面显著优于仅依赖指令的变体。两阶段训练进一步稳定了学习信号，增强了模型的接地效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，推理能力、分阶段优化以及结果驱动的强化学习对于构建更可验证和可靠的LLM具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [35] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION is a new local-global attention model that improves efficiency in short-context scenarios without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of local attention which completely disregards tokens outside the defined window, aiming to shift the Pareto frontier for better tradeoff between performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduce RATTENTION, a variant of local attention combined with a specialized linear attention mechanism to capture information from out-of-window tokens.

Result: Pretraining experiments show RATTENTION achieves superior Pareto tradeoff at different scales. A window size of 512 matches full-attention performance and enhances long-context performance.

Conclusion: RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while offering efficiency gains in short-context regimes.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现代语言模型虽然开放了权重，但训练数据仍然封闭，这限制了研究者对模型的理解和改进。为了克服这一限制，需要一种方法能够从模型权重中近似出训练数据，从而帮助研究者更好地理解模型的行为并改进其性能。

Result: 在AG新闻分类任务中，使用随机选择的数据训练模型只能达到65%的准确率，而使用本文方法选择的数据可以将准确率提升至80%，接近专家基准88%。在MSMARCO网络文档上的监督微调模型中，本文方法将困惑度从3.3降低到2.3，接近专家LLAMA模型的困惑度2.0。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于梯度的数据近似方法，能够在没有真实训练数据的情况下，从公共文本语料库中找到一小部分数据，用于训练接近原始模型性能的新模型。此方法在分类和监督微调任务中均表现出色，为研究封闭训练数据的语言模型提供了一种有效的工具。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: Predictive Generation (PredGen) reduces latency in voice chat apps by generating candidate responses while users are still speaking, cutting response time by about 2x with minimal extra computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often cause noticeable latency between user input and audio output in real-time voice chat applications, especially when deployed on consumer-grade hardware.

Method: The proposed method, Predictive Generation (PredGen), uses speculative decoding at input time to generate candidate responses while the user is still speaking. This allows the system to start Text-to-Speech (TTS) processing with minimal delay.

Result: Simulated experiments on Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets demonstrate that PredGen effectively reduces latency by around 2x across various use cases, with only minimal additional computation cost.

Conclusion: PredGen mitigates or eliminates the delay caused by LLMs in generating the first sentence for TTS systems, enhancing the user experience in real-time voice chat applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: Existing studies mainly focus on binary gender distinctions, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of gender inclusivity in LLMs.

Method: Developed GIFI, which includes evaluations at different levels from probing with gender pronouns to testing model generation and cognitive behaviors under various gender assumptions.

Result: Significant variations in gender inclusivity were found among 22 evaluated LLMs.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs' inclusivity is crucial, and GIFI provides a benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

### [40] [DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583)
*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), a new task and dataset for creating comprehensive scene graphs from multi-sentence image captions. They propose DiscoSG-Refiner, an efficient method that improves performance over existing baselines while significantly reducing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text scene graph parsers are designed for single-sentence captions and struggle with discourse-level inputs, leading to fragmented graphs and degraded performance in downstream Vision-Language Model tasks.

Method: Introduced DiscoSG, a new task supported by the DiscoSG-DS dataset containing multi-sentence caption-graph pairs. Proposed DiscoSG-Refiner which uses two small PLMs: one for drafting a base graph and another for iteratively proposing edits to improve efficiency and performance.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE scores by ~30% over the best baseline and is 86 times faster than GPT-4. It also enhances downstream VLM tasks like caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: DiscoSG and DiscoSG-Refiner provide a novel approach to discourse-level scene graph parsing, offering better performance and efficiency compared to fine-tuning large PLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating vision-language models' effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs and complex reasoning across multiple modalities.

Method: Introduced WikiMixQA, a benchmark of 1,000 MCQs covering tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages across seven topics. Evaluated 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models on this benchmark.

Result: Proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context but performance drops significantly with retrieval from long documents. GPT-4-o exceeds 50% accuracy in this setting while open-source models reach a maximum accuracy of 27%.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA highlights the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and serves as an important benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

TL;DR: 尽管生成式AI为自动化选择题（MCQ）生成提供了机会，但对其质量与可靠性的评估仍较少关注。本文研究了当前生成模型在葡萄牙语阅读理解中生成MCQ的能力，发现其质量接近人工编写，但仍存在语义清晰度、可回答性和干扰项设计等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建多难度和目标阅读技能的选择题耗时且昂贵，而生成式AI提供了解决方案。然而，生成式选择题的质量和可靠性评估尚未得到充分研究，特别是在实际应用中的失败案例方面。此外，大多数研究集中于英语，其他语言如葡萄牙语的研究较少。

Method: 研究专注于使用生成模型为葡萄牙语的阅读理解生成符合课程相关叙事元素和不同难度水平的选择题，并通过专家评审和学生回答的心理测量属性分析来评估这些题目。

Result: 结果显示，当前生成模型能够生成与人工编写的题目质量相当的选择题，但在语义清晰度、可回答性和高质量干扰项的设计上仍存在问题。

Conclusion: 生成模型在葡萄牙语MCQ生成方面具有潜力，但需要进一步改进以解决语义清晰度和干扰项设计等问题，确保题目适合小学教育环境。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中的后悔机制对于提高模型可靠性至关重要，并有助于揭示神经网络中认知的编码方式。然而，目前缺乏专门的数据集、度量方法来识别和分析后悔表达及其内部表示。

Method: 1. 提出通过战略性设计提示场景构建全面后悔数据集的工作流程；2. 引入S-CDI度量以找到最优后悔表示层；3. 提出RDS度量识别后悔神经元和GIC度量分析激活模式。

Result: 实验成功识别了最优后悔表示层，显著提升了探测分类实验性能；发现了模型层间的M形解耦模式；通过RDS度量将神经元分为三类功能性组。

Conclusion: 提出的度量和方法有效解决了现有研究中的关键挑战，为深入理解大型语言模型中的后悔机制提供了新的工具和视角。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

TL;DR: 通过三个实验和一个计算认知模型，研究英式英语和美式英语使用者对强化词的不同解释，发现跨文化差异源于字面意义不同及表达成本权重不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨文化交流中细微的解释差异是否来源于词语的字面意义还是诸如礼貌和简洁等普遍的语用因素。

Method: 进行三个实验，研究英式和美式英语使用者对强化词（如quite和very）的理解；开发一个计算认知模型，模拟听话者对说话者的递归推理过程，考虑信息量、礼貌和话语成本的平衡。

Result: 跨文化差异在强化词解释上来自于字面意义的不同和表达成本的不同权重。

Conclusion: 跨文化解释差异并非单纯由语义变化或礼貌规范决定，而是两者的复杂相互作用导致的。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [45] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks, LLMs can generate sentences with given concepts but may struggle when a specific concept order is required. This study introduces Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark to evaluate both compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs by measuring ordered coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of LLMs in following instructions regarding concept order while generating sentences, which is crucial for generative commonsense reasoning tasks.

Method: Propose a new benchmark called Ordered CommonGen to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating sentences that adhere to a specified concept order. Measure ordered coverage as an evaluation metric.

Result: Comprehensive analysis of 36 LLMs showed that even though they generally understand instructions, their outputs often lack diversity due to biases towards certain concept order patterns. The best-performing model achieved only about 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: There is a need for further improvement in LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在许多任务中表现出色，但在一致性和稳健推理方面仍有困难。本文提出了基于群体的一致性学习（CC-Learn），通过强化学习框架提高LLM推理的可靠性。该方法通过对共享程序化抽象的相似问题进行训练，定义了结合群体准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚的复合目标，从而优化推理一致性。实验表明，CC-Learn提高了推理准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在很多任务上表现出色，但它们在一致性和稳健推理方面仍然存在挑战，需要一种新方法来提高其推理的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn)的强化学习框架。该框架通过对从共享程序化抽象中派生的相似问题组进行训练，以提高LLM推理的可靠性。为了确保群体级的一致性，定义了一个复合目标，包括群体准确性、有效的检索奖励以及对简单或无效查询的拒绝惩罚。这些元素可以通过强化学习直接优化，而监督微调则无法实现这一点。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试（如ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA）中，CC-Learn显著提高了准确性和推理稳定性，超越了预训练和SFT基线模型。

Conclusion: 基于群体的强化学习有效提升了LLM推理的一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型的推理痕迹中存在隐私泄露问题，尤其是在增加推理步骤等测试时计算方法的情况下。尽管更谨慎的最终答案需要更多预算，但也会导致更详细的推理过程和更多的隐私泄露。因此，提高推理能力虽然改善了模型的实用性，但也扩大了隐私攻击面。安全性努力不应只局限于模型的输出，还应涵盖其内部思考过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战关于推理痕迹安全性的假设，揭示推理痕迹可能包含敏感用户数据，并通过注入提示或意外泄露到输出中。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，特别关注测试时计算方法（如增加推理步骤）对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 证明了测试时计算方法，尤其是增加推理步骤，放大了隐私泄露；更高的预算使模型在最终答案上更加谨慎，但也导致更详细的推理过程和更多的隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 安全性工作必须扩展到模型的内部思考过程，而不仅仅是其输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

TL;DR: The study evaluates 21 MT systems' handling of gender neutrality across three translation directions, finding mostly disappointing results with a few exceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving gender ambiguity in translations from notional gender languages to grammatical gender languages, avoiding misgendering and representational harms.

Method: Assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity across three translation directions, categorizing and discussing observed gender-neutral strategies while examining the effect of binary gender stereotypes.

Result: Most MT systems fail to provide gender-neutral translations when faced with gender ambiguity. A small number of systems employ specific strategies for gender-neutral translation based on the target language.

Conclusion: There is a significant lack of gender-neutral translations in current MT systems, highlighting the need for improvement in this area.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Motivation: Despite the great performance of recent VLMs, deploying them in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands.

Method: The proposed method is called Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), which is a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs.

Result: Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Conclusion: GenRecal is an effective solution for the deployment of VLMs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging

### [55] [ViLLa: A Neuro-Symbolic approach for Animal Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14823)
*Harsha Koduri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework named ViLLa is introduced, which integrates visual detection, language parsing, and symbolic reasoning to interpret animal monitoring data and answer human queries about visual content in a transparent way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for monitoring animal populations often lack the ability to effectively interpret both visual data and human language queries. There is a need for a system that can bridge these two types of information while providing interpretable answers.

Method: ViLLa combines three key components: a visual detection module that identifies animals and their locations in images, a language parser that understands natural language questions, and a symbolic reasoning layer that uses logic-based inference to provide answers related to count, presence, and location of animals in the image.

Result: ViLLa was evaluated on various animal imagery tasks and showed the capability to connect visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries effectively.

Conclusion: ViLLa provides a modular and transparent approach to interpreting animal monitoring data by separating perception, understanding, and reasoning processes.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,

### [56] [GraphGSOcc: Semantic and Geometric Graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825)
*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphGSOcc, a new model for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformers to address limitations in existing 3D Gaussian Splating methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splating methods have two main issues: unified feature aggregation neglects semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and boundary ambiguities are caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization.

Method: The authors propose the GraphGSOcc model which uses Dual Gaussians Graph Attention to dynamically construct dual graph structures - a geometric graph for adaptive KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses and a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity. This is coupled with a Multi-scale Graph Attention framework for fine-grained attention at lower layers and coarse-grained attention at higher layers.

Result: Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset show an mIoU of 24.10%, with reduced GPU memory usage of 6.1 GB. This represents a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively addresses the limitations of current 3D Gaussian Splating methods by integrating semantic and geometric information, leading to improved performance and reduced memory consumption.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

*Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Hongyu Su,Juncheng Li,Yunhan Zhao,Lin Luo,Zixing Chen,Li Wang,Xin Wang,Yixu Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: As AI-generated video becomes pervasive, distinguishing synthetic content from authentic footage has become urgent. Existing approaches offer limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. To address this gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is the urgency and necessity to reliably distinguish AI-generated video content from authentic footage across media platforms. The authors aim to go beyond binary classification by providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike.

Method: The method involves introducing DAVID-X, a dataset pairing AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. They also present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model that provides an interpretable chain of visual reasoning including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations.

Result: A general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on their compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes.

Conclusion: The results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Conclusion: MonoVQD通过创新性的设计改进了DETR-based单目3D检测，有效解决了关键问题并提升了性能，具有广泛的适用性和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [62] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ChartIR, an iterative refinement method based on structured instructions to improve MLLMs' performance in chart-to-code generation. It distinguishes visual understanding and code translation tasks, designs specific instructions for each, and decomposes the pipeline into initial code generation and iterative refinement stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, but their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This motivates the need for a more effective approach to this complex task.

Method: The proposed method, ChartIR, consists of two main components: visual understanding and code translation. For visual understanding, two types of structured instructions are designed - description and difference instructions. The overall chart generation pipeline is then decomposed into two stages - initial code generation and iterative refinement.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: ChartIR, with its structured instructions and iterative refinement approach, effectively improves the performance of MLLMs in chart-to-code generation.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 在数据稀缺领域构建图像分类模型仍然很困难，因为收集大型标注数据集不切实际。本文提出了PictSure框架，该框架专注于嵌入模型（架构、预训练和训练动态）对少样本图像分类的影响。研究表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功和域外性能。PictSure在域外基准测试中优于现有的基于ICL的少样本图像分类模型，同时在域内任务上保持可比结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域构建图像分类模型存在挑战，而现有研究忽略了图像嵌入在基于上下文学习（ICL）的少样本图像分类中的作用。

Method: 提出PictSure框架，系统地研究不同的视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对下游少样本图像分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验证明，嵌入模型的预训练方式对训练成功和域外性能有重大影响，PictSure在域外基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型的预训练，在域外少样本图像分类任务中表现出色，同时在域内任务上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kernel size selection in CNNs significantly impacts model performance. This paper introduces BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size determination per layer, balancing information gain, efficiency, and accuracy. Experiments show improvements in accuracy and reductions in computational cost across various datasets and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN designs often use uniform 3x3 kernels without considering the potential benefits of varying kernel sizes. There is a need for a systematic approach to select kernel sizes that balance computational cost, feature extraction, and model accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes BKSEF, which integrates principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to determine optimal kernel sizes layer-wise. This involves evaluating information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate up to 3.1% accuracy improvement and 42.8% reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models. Real-world case studies in medical image classification and traffic sign recognition further validate the effectiveness of BKSEF.

Conclusion: BKSEF provides a mathematically grounded and empirically validated approach to optimize kernel sizes in CNNs, offering practical heuristics for efficient and application-aware designs.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: 准确的视频标注在现代零售应用中至关重要，包括顾客行为分析、产品互动检测和店内活动识别。然而，传统方法依赖于耗时的人工标注，导致非鲁棒的关键帧选择和运营成本增加。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，可以自动识别零售视频中的关键帧，并提供产品和客户的自动标注。通过实验验证，该方法比传统方法更优越，具有与人工标注相当的准确性，同时提高了零售视频标注的整体效率。显著地，该方法平均节省了2倍的视频标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频标注方法过于依赖人工，存在效率低、成本高和不稳定性的问题，特别是在零售领域。需要一种自动化的方法来提高效率并降低成本。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，利用深度神经网络学习区分性特征，通过嵌入视频帧并结合针对零售环境定制的目标检测技术，实现对零售视频的关键帧自动识别和标注。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法的性能优于传统方法，达到了与人工标注相当的准确性，同时大幅提升了标注效率，并实现了平均2倍的成本节约。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习方法能够有效自动化零售视频的关键帧检测和标注过程，显著减少时间和精力的投入，为零售应用（如购物者旅程分析、产品互动检测和店内安全监控）提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel active view selection (AVS) approach for 3D reconstruction using neural uncertainty maps predicted by UPNet, achieving comparable accuracy with fewer viewpoints and significantly reduced computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction, improving efficiency and reducing computational overhead in AVS methods.

Method: Introduced UPNet, a lightweight feedforward deep neural network that predicts uncertainty maps from single input images. The approach aggregates these maps to suppress redundant viewpoints and selects the most informative ones for training 3D neural rendering models.

Result: Achieved comparable reconstruction accuracy using half the viewpoints of the upper bound, with up to 400 times speedup and over 50% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Also generalized effectively to novel object categories without additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed AVS method using UPNet successfully reduces computational requirements while maintaining high-quality 3D reconstructions, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment through Hybrid Loss, Kernelized Representations, and Divergence Selection. It also presents DETONATE, a large-scale benchmark assessing social bias in T2I systems, and AQI, a geometric measure quantifying alignment quality.


<details>

Motivation: To improve the alignment of text-to-image models ensuring generated images capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.

Method: DPO-Kernels enhance alignment across three dimensions: Hybrid Loss integrating embedding-based objectives with probability-based loss; Kernelized Representations using RBF, Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for feature transformations; and Divergence Selection incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences. Additionally, DETONATE is introduced as a benchmark with 100K image pairs and AQI as a geometric measure.

Result: Empirical results show that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels significantly improve alignment in T2I models, providing enhanced optimization, richer feature transformations, and improved stability. The introduction of DETONATE and AQI offers valuable tools for assessing and improving alignment in T2I systems.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法FCRE，用于在医疗图像扩散模型上进行成员推断攻击（MIA），通过聚焦中频范围的重建误差来提高隐私风险评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MIA方法依赖于扩散重建误差，在医疗图像上应用时存在挑战，因为重建误差受图像固有难度和高频细节重建困难的影响。

Method: 提出Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) 方法，专注于特定中频范围的重建误差，并排除高频和低频区域的影响。分析逆扩散过程，获取中频重建误差，并计算重构图像与原始图像之间的结构相似性指数分数，以此判断成员身份。

Result: 实验表明，FCRE方法在多个医疗图像数据集上优于现有的MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法能够有效缓解图像固有难度对MIA的干扰，在医疗图像扩散模型的成员推断攻击中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets using calorimeter images, showing that ViT-based models outperform traditional CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is crucial in high-energy physics but remains challenging. While deep learning methods like CNNs have been used, the potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has not been fully explored for this task, especially under realistic conditions.

Method: The authors use simulated 2012 CMS Open Data to construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits and reconstructed tracks. They then evaluate ViT and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification, comparing their performance against established CNN baselines.

Result: ViT-based models, particularly ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, demonstrating the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure.

Conclusion: This study establishes the first systematic framework for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, providing robust performance baselines and a structured dataset for further research.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using

TL;DR: The paper proposes two models based on LRCNs and Transformer architectures for predicting compliance metrics using RGB tactile images and other information from GelSight sensor. These models show significant performance improvement over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection methods have limitations in terms of portability, scalability, and accuracy. Neural network-based approaches still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy.

Method: Two models are proposed based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures. They leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately.

Result: The models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline when validated using multiple metrics. The correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation shows that harder objects than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: The proposed models effectively estimate compliance metrics with improved accuracy, offering advancements over traditional methods and previous neural network-based approaches.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

### [72] [Hyper-Local Deformable Transformers for Text Spotting on Historical Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15010)
*Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps with a novel hyper-local sampling module and SynthMap+, a method to generate synthetic map images. Experiments show that PALETTE outperforms current methods on historical map datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of effective methods and training data. Existing approaches are tailored to specific map styles and machine learning-based methods face difficulties in extracting precise image features for predicting sub-components in a text instance.

Method: PALETTE introduces a hyper-local sampling module to learn localized image features around target boundary points and characters for detection and recognition, as well as hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters. Additionally, SynthMap+ is presented as a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images for training text spotters.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms state-of-the-art text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. It has been deployed to process over 60,000 maps and generated over 100 million text labels.

Conclusion: PALETTE is an effective solution for text spotting on historical maps, overcoming challenges posed by lengthy, rotated text and complex backgrounds.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents StyleWallfacer, a novel framework for style transfer and text-driven stylization that uses semantic-based style injection, human feedback data augmentation, and a triple diffusion process to achieve high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in traditional style transfer methods and unify the framework for different tasks, enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization.

Method: 1) Semantic-based style injection method using BLIP and CLIP space; 2) Data augmentation strategy based on human feedback; 3) Training-free triple diffusion process manipulating self-attention layers.

Result: Achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization with artist-level results while preserving original image content. Also achieved image color editing during style transfer for the first time.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer revolutionizes the field of style transfer by providing a unified framework that addresses various issues and delivers superior results.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

TL;DR: The paper addresses training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization by using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions, achieving high codebook utilization and reduced quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to the mismatch between the distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss.

Method: The authors employ the Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors in order to resolve the issues of training instability and codebook collapse.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces the quantization error.

Conclusion: Empirical and theoretical analyses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the limitations of current vector quantization techniques.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: Existing training-free methods based on Large Vision Models (LVMs) fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, resulting in poor performance on low-contrast medical images.

Method: Propose SynPo which includes designing a Confidence Map Synergy Module combining DINOv2 and SAM strengths, selecting top-k pixels as positive points set, choosing negative points set using Gaussian distribution, and performing independent K-means clustering for both sets. These selected points are used as high-quality prompts for SAM to obtain segmentation results.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: SynPo is a promising training-free few-shot method based on LVMs that significantly enhances the utilization of negative prompts, leading to improved performance on low-contrast medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to

Conclusion: PDSA模块提高了点云分析的计算效率和鲁棒性，具有良好的泛化能力和性能提升效果。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and
training weight is available at: https://github.com/AGENT9717/PointDistribution

TL;DR: ReSeDis is introduced as the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding, offering a realistic testbed for building robust multimodal search systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques only address one side of the challenge faced by large-scale visual search engines. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but produces false alarms when applied to web-scale collections, while text-to-image retrieval excels at ranking relevant images but offers no fine-grained localization.

Method: The paper introduces Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), which must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. A benchmark is curated with unique mappings of descriptions to object instances, and a task-specific metric is designed to score retrieval recall and localization precision.

Result: A zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model reveals significant headroom for future study.

Conclusion: ReSeDis provides a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of specialized models that are only applicable to predefined tasks by developing generalist models which can adapt to various tasks without task-specific development.

Method: Training generalist models for retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL) with few examples provided at inference time, and proposing a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT.

Result: Established a first baseline for in-context learning in OCT, highlighting its potential and current limitations.

Conclusion: Generalist models trained with VICL show promise for retinal OCT analysis, but have limitations that need further research. The open release of code aims to promote further research and practical adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) with a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function to protect images from VLP models while maintaining compression functionality and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to protect users' privacy by preventing publicly posted images from being exploited by vision-language pretrained (VLP) models through implementing defenses at the image compression stage.

Method: The method involves proposing PSIC, which produces bitstreams with multiple decoding options. It includes CLTG for generating bias information and UAEO for optimizing encryption based on VLP model uncertainty. An adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy is also incorporated.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in protecting images while maintaining compression functionality and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed PSIC scheme is effective, plug-and-play, and can be integrated into existing LIC models.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) is proposed for multimodal medical image fusion, which enhances feature recognition and interaction, leading to high-quality fused images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, resulting in suboptimal fused image quality.

Method: The study proposes DM-FNet with two stages: Stage I uses a diffusion process to train UNet for image reconstruction, capturing detailed information. Stage II inputs noisy images into the fusion network and integrates three key fusion modules to adaptively process different modalities. A hybrid loss function is also used.

Result: Experimental results across various medical image types show exceptional performance in objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves brightness, radioactive tracer distribution, textures, and edges.

Conclusion: DM-FNet addresses limitations of existing MMIF methods by enhancing feature recognition and interaction, leading to high-quality fused images suitable for comprehensive and accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解中的关键挑战是如何生成详细且准确的自然语言描述，特别是在结合音频信息的情况下。

Method: 提出了video-SALMONN 2模型，采用低秩适应（LoRA）和定向偏好优化（DPO），并引入多轮DPO (MrDPO)方法来提升训练效果。该方法包括周期性更新DPO参考模型、合并和重新初始化LoRA模块以及利用真实视频字幕进行指导。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN 2通过创新的训练策略和模型设计，在视频字幕生成任务上达到了新的高度，同时代码已开源。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN substantially enhances the performance of SAR ship detection in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement

enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The

proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

*Qingsong Yan,Qiang Wang,Kaiyong Zhao,Jie Chen,Bo Li,Xiaowen Chu,Fei Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-NeRF is a new method that can predict highly accurate camera poses even with complex trajectories by using photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction and SLAM tools like NeRF and 3DGS require accurate camera pose priors, but current approaches to achieve this are not satisfactory, especially for complex camera trajectories.

Method: RA-NeRF uses an incremental pipeline where it reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency, incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization, and employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate noise for pose estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets show RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF effectively and robustly reconstructs scenes under complex pose trajectories.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

### [85] [Retrospective Memory for Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15244)
*Chenxi Zhang,Jiayun Wu,Qing Zhang,Yazhe Zhai,Youwei Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RetroMem, a recall-augmented architecture for camouflaged object detection (COD) that integrates historical knowledge to enhance perception and inference. It uses a two-stage training paradigm with Dense Multi-scale Adapter (DMA) for learning and Dynamic Memory Mechanism (DMM) along with Inference Pattern Reconstruction (IPR) for recall, significantly improving performance on COD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods rely on static visual representation modeling without explicit mechanisms to acquire historical context, which limits their effectiveness in challenging scenes.

Method: RetroMem employs a two-stage training process: 1) Learning stage with DMA to capture multi-scale visual information from pretrained encoder; 2) Recall stage with DMM and IPR to reconstruct camouflage pattern inference using learned knowledge.

Result: RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on several widely used datasets for camouflaged object detection.

Conclusion: RetroMem enhances COD by dynamically modulating pattern perception and inference through integration of historical knowledge, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: In the semiconductor sector, deep learning methods like Domain Adaptation (DA) are crucial for reducing time to market and enhancing quality. The paper proposes DBACS, a CycleGAN-inspired model with additional loss terms, tested on Electron Microscope images in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high demand, competition, and need for efficiency in the semiconductor industry by leveraging the success of deep learning methods, particularly Domain Adaptation (DA), which reduces manual re-labeling and re-training.

Method: The DBACS approach, inspired by CycleGAN and enhanced with additional loss terms, is proposed and tested in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings using real-world Electron Microscope images.

Result: The approaches were validated on real-world Electron Microscope images, demonstrating the effectiveness of DBACS in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

Conclusion: DBACS proves useful in improving robustness and scalability in domain adaptation for semiconductor applications, reducing computational costs and allowing experts to focus on high-value tasks.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

TL;DR: MSNeRV是一种用于神经视频表示的多尺度特征融合框架，它通过增强时间一致性、多分辨率和多频率信息集成以及改进特征提取，在动态场景中表现出比VTM-23.7更好的压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR方法在处理细节密集和快速变化的视频内容时存在困难，主要是因为内部网络特性的利用不足以及网络设计缺乏对视频特性的考虑。

Method: 提出了一种多尺度特征融合框架MSNeRV。编码阶段采用时间窗口增强时间一致性，并将视频分为多个GoPs，使用GoP级别的网格进行背景表示。设计了具有尺度自适应损失函数的多尺度空间解码器，以整合多分辨率和多频率信息。还引入了一个多尺度特征块，以充分利用隐藏特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在INR方法中表现出优越的表示能力，并且在动态场景中的压缩效率方面超越了VTM-23.7（随机访问）。

Conclusion: MSNeRV在视频表示和压缩方面展现了卓越的能力，特别是在动态场景中的压缩效率方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches for ME spotting and recognition are suboptimal, especially for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers new opportunities to enhance ME analysis.

Method: The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks: ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and recognition in a sequential pipeline; and ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which uses MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs.

Result: Participating algorithms will be tested on a specific dataset and their results will be ranked on a leaderboard.

Conclusion: The integration of ME spotting and recognition in a unified pipeline and the use of MLLMs/LVLMs for ME understanding represent evolving research directions in facial micro-expression analysis.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating

*Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Shichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes OpenPath, an open-set active learning approach for pathology image classification using a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance selection of In-Distribution and informative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Active Learning methods are mostly designed for closed-set scenarios, leading to inefficiency when dealing with Out-Of-Distribution data in real-world clinical unlabeled pools. Also, random selection in the first query round causes labeling cost waste in open-set scenarios.

Method: OpenPath leverages a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In the first query round, task-specific prompts combining target and relevant non-target class prompts are used. In subsequent rounds, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) including Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is employed to ensure purity and informativeness while avoiding OOD samples.

Result: Experiments on two public pathology image datasets demonstrate that OpenPath significantly improves model performance due to high purity of selected samples and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Conclusion: OpenPath addresses the challenges of existing AL methods by effectively selecting ID and informative samples, enhancing model performance in pathology image classification.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several

Motivation: Object counting in videos is particularly challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects. The need to avoid double counting and identify reappearances motivates the development of a specialized model.

Method: Introduced CountVid model leverages an image-based counting model and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model for automated, open-world object counting across video frames.

Conclusion: CountVid model successfully addresses the challenges of open-world object counting in videos. The VideoCount dataset, CountVid model, and all the code are publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the

Motivation: To address the challenge of geometric distortions in animal fur or skin patterns caused by body movements and posture changes, which affects the accuracy of individual re-identification methods.

Method: Propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that uses surface normal estimation to unwarp pelage patterns into a canonical UV space, preserving geometric consistency between 3D surface and 2D texture space. The method is integrated with existing re-identification techniques and can be trained self-supervised without ground truth UV annotations.

Result: Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show an improvement of up to 5.4% in re-identification accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles.

Conclusion: The geometry-aware texture mapping approach enables more robust feature matching for animal re-identification, particularly for species with highly deformable fur patterns.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

*Yujin Kim,Hyunsoo Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDIS, a Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that improves synthetic image quality by leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model as an image prior. It includes Domain Alignment Guidance and Class Alignment Token for better alignment with the training data distribution, showing SOTA performance in data-free applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFIS methods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to lack of prior knowledge about natural images when pre-trained model's training data is unavailable.

Method: Propose DDIS which uses a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, introducing Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) and optimizing a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding.

Result: Experiments on PACS and ImageNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution.

Conclusion: DDIS achieves SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

*Anju Chhetri,Jari Korhonen,Prashnna Gyawali,Binod Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In medical imaging, distinguishing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for model reliability. This paper proposes NERO, a new OOD scoring method that uses neuron-level relevance to improve detection accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of deep learning models in medical imaging by improving the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.

Method: NERO leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer, clusters this relevance for each in-distribution class to form centroids, and uses a relevance distance metric to measure deviation from these centroids. Scaled relevance in the bias term and feature norms are also incorporated.

Result: Validated across multiple deep learning architectures on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision), NERO shows improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Conclusion: NERO provides a novel approach for OOD detection in medical imaging that enhances separability and offers explainability.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了GenHOI，一个用于4D人-物交互（HOI）合成的两阶段框架。通过Object-AnchorNet和Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM)，实现了对未见物体的良好泛化以及高质量4D HOI序列生成。在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到业界领先水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型和大规模运动数据集推动了文本驱动的人类动作合成的发展，但将其扩展到4D人类-物体交互（HOI）仍面临挑战，主要原因在于缺乏大规模4D HOI数据集。

Method: 研究引入了GenHOI，一个新型两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中学习，重建稀疏3D HOI关键帧以适应未见物体；第二阶段采用Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM)将稀疏3D HOI关键帧插值为时间上连贯的4D HOI序列，并提出Contact-Aware Encoder和Contact-Aware HOI Attention来提升生成质量。

Conclusion: GenHOI框架有效缓解了对大规模4D HOI数据集的依赖，实现了对未见物体的良好泛化以及高质量4D HOI序列的生成。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Motivation: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from LGE cardiac MRI has great potential for diagnosis and treatment planning but is restricted by limited availability and variability of high-quality images with scar labels.

Method: Introduced CLAIM framework includes SMILE module for scar mask generation guided by clinical knowledge and uses AHA 17-segment model. Joint training strategy optimizes scar segmentation network alongside generator for enhanced realism and accuracy.

Result: Experimental results indicate that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns with higher Dice similarity to real scar distributions compared to baseline models.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated

Conclusion: RaCalNet通过使用稀疏LiDAR监督来学习改进的雷达测量值，成功地消除了对密集监督的需求，并在多个实验中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Conclusion: WinWinLay在无需特定数据训练的情况下，有效提升了布局到图像生成的精度和真实性。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Existing methods for high-resolution land cover classification focus on 1-meter resolution imagery and depend heavily on annotated data, which is impractical for higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery that uses the knowledge of SAM2 and incorporates a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while keeping a lightweight design.

Result: The proposed method achieves robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, showing a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: The parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework effectively leverages unlabeled data and maintains minimal parameter overhead, offering an advancement in ultra-high spatial resolution land cover classification.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel unified framework for estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) through 3D tree structural reconstruction using an innovative graph-based pipeline, which enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds and significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools.


<details>

Motivation: Estimating AGB is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Current QSM methods face limitations as they are designed for individual trees, depend on high-quality TLS data, and require multiple pre-processing steps.

Method: The study proposes a graph-based pipeline that integrates tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. This approach allows end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds.

Result: Experimental results show strong performance under challenging conditions with ~20% relative error in leaf-on scenarios and ~30% relative error in low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation, reducing dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishing ULS as a viable alternative to TLS.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the

*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DLoRAL提出了一种基于双LoRA学习范式的视频超分辨率方法，通过交叉帧检索模块和一致性/细节增强的LoRA分支，实现了时空一致且细节丰富的高质量视频恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于稳定扩散模型（SD）的视频超分辨率方法在处理真实场景时，往往为了保持时间一致性而牺牲空间细节，导致视觉质量不理想。因此需要一种新方法，在增强视频细节的同时保持时间一致性。

Method: 提出了Dual LoRA Learning（DLoRAL）范式，包含两个阶段：1) 使用Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) 模块聚合帧间信息，并通过Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) 学习鲁棒的时间表示；2) 固定CFR和C-LoRA模块，使用Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) 增强空间细节，同时与C-LoRA定义的时间空间对齐以保持一致性。这两个阶段交替迭代优化，最终将两个LoRA分支合并到SD模型中，实现单步扩散的高效高质量视频恢复。

Result: 实验表明，DLoRAL在准确性和速度上均表现出色，能够生成时空一致且细节丰富的视频。代码和模型已开源。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过结合时间一致性和空间细节增强，成功解决了现有方法在视频超分辨率中时间和空间性能权衡的问题，为高效高质量的视频恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M2M-Reg框架和GradCyCon正则化方法，解决异质模态图像配准问题，实验表明其在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中性能优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中，功能特性成像（如PET、FA）需要与结构性参考（如MRI、CT）对齐进行准确解释或群体分析，但传统无监督DIR方法难以学习可靠的映射关系并易导致图像失真。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练多模态DIR模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器以促进微分同胚。该框架可自然扩展到半监督设置中，无需真实变换或分割掩码。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中的DSC比先前方法高出2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg框架有效解决了高度异质多模态DIR问题，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无重建的在线框架，用于高效的3D物体检测，结合Cubify Anything和CLIP模型，通过关联和优化模块实现多视角融合，实验表明其性能优越且具有广泛的应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D物体检测方法依赖密集点云重建，导致计算开销大、内存限制严重，难以实现实时应用。为解决此问题，需要一种无需重建的高效实时3D检测框架。

Method: 利用Cubify Anything作为预训练视觉基础模型进行单视图3D物体检测，结合CLIP捕捉开放词汇表语义；通过关联模块（使用3D NMS和框对应匹配）和优化模块（基于粒子滤波的IoU引导随机优化技术）融合多视角检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在在线方法中达到了最先进的性能，展现出强大的泛化能力，能够实现实时感知，即使在超过1000平方米的环境中也是如此。

Conclusion: 所提出的无重建在线框架实现了高效、实时的3D物体检测，具有良好的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for generating realistic human-object interactions (HOIs), which uses Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) to balance realism and physical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI generation methods struggle to balance realism and physical correctness.

Method: HOIDiNi optimizes in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using DNO, separating the process into an object-centric phase for hand-object contact choices and a human-centric phase for refining full-body motion.

Result: HOIDiNi outperforms prior works in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality on the GRAB dataset, demonstrating the ability to generate complex interactions like grasping, placing, and full-body coordination via textual prompts.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi successfully generates realistic and plausible HOIs while maintaining both realism and physical correctness.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

TL;DR: 研究人员引入了一个新的基准测试，用于评估在Habitat模拟器中的长期具身任务。该基准包含60个需要持续参与和环境意识的任务，并且可以扩展到更长、更具挑战性的版本。同时，他们还提供了结合最先进的视觉-语言模型与低级导航策略的基线，以评估其在这些记忆密集型任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型在规划和控制任务中表现出色，但将其应用于真实世界机器人技术受到限制，因为它们难以处理跨多天收集的大量图像所代表的长期经验。当前模型通常无法同时处理超过几百张图像，因此需要更有效的机制来处理具身体验中的长期记忆。此外，现有的长视频问答基准忽略了物体操作和导航等具身体验挑战。

Method: 研究者们在Habitat模拟器中引入了一个新的基准测试，用于长期具身任务。该基准涵盖60个任务，要求在环境中保持持续参与和情境意识。这些任务可以通过程序扩展为更长和更具挑战性的版本。他们还将最先进的视觉-语言模型与低级导航策略相结合，提供基线并评估其在记忆密集型任务上的表现。

Result: 新基准测试能够有效评估记忆和推理能力，同时通过扩展任务长度和复杂性，实现对记忆和推理的可扩展评估。结合最先进的视觉-语言模型与低级导航策略的基线评估揭示了改进的方向。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在具身体验中有效整合记忆的重要性，并通过引入新的基准测试和基线评估，推动了在长期记忆和推理方面的研究进展。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 近期的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉-语言任务基准上表现出色，但输入视觉质量对其响应的影响尚不清楚。研究表明，图像的感知质量提高并不一定意味着MLLMs理解能力的提升，反而有时降低图像保真度能改善模型表现。为此，研究提出了视觉质量测试时调整（VQ-TTT），通过轻量级适应模块动态调整输入图像以匹配特定任务的模型偏好，从而显著提高平均准确率。这重新定义了对MLLMs而言“更好”的视觉输入，并强调了适应性图像处理的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉-语言任务中表现出色，但关于输入视觉质量如何影响其响应的研究较少。因此，需要系统地研究视觉质量对MLLMs性能的影响，并探索如何根据模型偏好调整输入图像以优化性能。

Method: 通过对主流MLLMs和一系列视觉-语言基准进行系统研究，应用受控降级和风格变化来分析图像质量对模型性能的影响。发现视觉质量悖论后，提出VQ-TTT方法：1) 在冻结的视觉编码器前插入一个可学习的低秩核以调节频率内容；2) 通过LoRA微调浅层视觉编码器层。该方法能够在单次前向传播中动态调整输入图像以符合任务特定的模型偏好。

Result: VQ-TTT方法在无需外部模型、缓存特征或额外训练数据的情况下，显著提高了评估的所有MLLMs和数据集上的平均准确率，证明了适应性图像处理的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了视觉质量对MLLMs性能的复杂影响，并提出了一种有效的适应性图像调整方法VQ-TTT。这表明，在AI为主要数据消费者的新时代，应关注适应性而非普遍意义上的“干净”图像，以优化MLLMs的表现。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: 尽管在视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的推理时间搜索方面取得了显著进展，但现有方法仍然计算成本高昂，并且容易产生未被惩罚、低置信度的生成结果，通常导致持续的幻觉问题。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了基于价值引导与边缘奖励的两阶段推理框架ViMaR。该框架通过结合时差价值模型与边缘感知奖励调整，提高了效率和输出保真度。实验表明，ViMaR生成的标题更可靠、事实更准确、细节更丰富、解释性更强，同时相比现有的价值引导方法速度提升了4倍以上。此外，ViMaR还展示了在不同模型间的有效泛化能力，并且通过自我训练进一步提升了底层模型在多种视觉理解基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型的推理方法存在计算成本高和生成结果低置信度的问题，这可能导致持续的幻觉现象，影响模型的实际应用效果。因此，需要一种新的推理框架来提高生成结果的质量和效率，同时减少幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为ViMaR的两阶段推理框架：第一阶段通过单次遍历从多样候选中识别出最高价值的标题；第二阶段选择性地优化那些被忽略或视觉基础薄弱的部分，同时通过校准的边缘惩罚机制抑制低置信度的延续，保持描述的丰富性。

Result: ViMaR生成的标题在可靠性、事实准确性、细节和解释性方面显著优于现有方法，并且在速度上实现了超过4倍的提升。此外，ViMaR在不同模型间表现出良好的泛化能力，能够指导更强的未见过模型的解码过程。通过自我训练，使用ViMaR生成的标题还能显著提升底层模型在多种视觉理解基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: ViMaR作为一种可扩展和可转移的推理时解码策略，不仅提高了视觉-语言模型生成标题的质量和效率，还展示了跨模型的灵活性和模块化特性。其在自我训练中的应用进一步证明了快速、准确和自我改进的VLM流水线的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing end-to-end relighting models which are restricted by paired multi-illumination data scarcity and two-stage pipelines that suffer from error accumulation and inability to produce realistic outputs under complex conditions.

Method: Introduced a single-pass method combining albedo estimation and relit output synthesis utilizing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. The model is trained on both synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像但推理缓慢且计算成本高，现有的缓存方法因依赖僵化的启发式规则而导致加速有限或泛化性差。

Method: 提出了一种名为ECAD的方法，使用遗传算法学习高效的、针对每个模型的缓存计划，形成帕累托前沿，仅使用少量校准提示符。

Result: 在PixArt-alpha等模型上的实验表明，ECAD在COCO FID等指标上优于先前的方法，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且可泛化的方法，能够有效加速扩散模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available
