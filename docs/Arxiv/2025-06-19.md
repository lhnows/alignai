### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients. It includes 14 clinically significant AEs along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. The annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of clinical NLP resources focusing on elderly patients, which are often underrepresented. Additionally, prior work rarely addresses challenges related to discontinuous and overlapping entities in AE extraction.

Method: The dataset was developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) and includes multiple clinically significant AEs along with contextual attributes. Multiple models were evaluated using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation.

Result: Transformer-based models achieved strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), but performance dropped notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language despite high-level scores in document-level coarse-grained extraction.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoostCD通过结合受约束和不受约束的解码来提高结构化NLP任务中的输出质量，特别是在封闭信息提取任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化NLP任务中，许多方法使用自回归语言模型进行映射，但这些模型在测试时可能产生低质量输出。因此需要一种方法来改善受约束解码的质量。

Method: 提出了一种名为Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) 的两阶段方法：第一阶段从基础模型以受约束和不受约束两种模式解码获得两个初步预测；第二阶段通过一个学习到的自回归增强模型将这两个初步预测组合成最终预测。

Result: BoostCD应用于封闭信息提取任务时，其模型BoostIE在分布内和分布外都优于先前的方法，并解决了那些方法中常见的几种错误。

Conclusion: BoostCD能够有效提高受约束解码的质量，对于结构化NLP任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrEst, a weakly supervised framework to assess context document credibility for LLMs without manual annotations. It offers two integration strategies and shows consistent improvements in accuracy and F1 score across experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods integrating contextual information into LLMs often overlook the variability in context document credibility, risking unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst is a weakly supervised framework that leverages inter-document agreement to estimate credibility based on semantic coherence among credible documents. Two integration strategies are proposed: a black-box approach for models with no access to internal parameters and a white-box method modifying attention mechanisms.

Result: Experiments across three model architectures and five datasets show CrEst outperforms strong baselines with up to 26.86% improvement in accuracy and 3.49% in F1 score, maintaining robustness under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: CrEst effectively enhances the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks by assessing and incorporating context document credibility.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR:  MDBench 是一个用于评估大型语言模型在多文档推理任务上的新数据集，通过一种新颖的合成生成方法创建，这种方法基于浓缩的结构化种子知识，并通过大型语言模型辅助编辑以引入特定于多文档的推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  自然语言处理评估取得了显著进展，主要得益于强大的大型语言模型的发展。然而，尽管多文档推理对于处理长上下文输入的大型语言模型来说是一个极其相关的领域，但很少有基准能够严格检查模型在这种设置下的行为。此外，由于标注长输入的成本昂贵，为多文档设置创建基准一直具有挑战性。

Method:  MDBench 通过一种新颖的合成生成过程创建，该过程可以可控且高效地生成具有挑战性的文档集和相应的问答示例。具体而言，该技术基于浓缩的结构化种子知识，通过大型语言模型辅助编辑来引入特定于多文档的推理挑战。然后将这种结构化知识转换为自然文本形式，生成文档集和对应的问答示例。

Result:  研究发现，MDBench 对所有方法都提出了重大挑战，即使是在相对较短的文档集上。此外，他们的知识引导生成技术使得针对多文档特定推理能力的分析变得容易，并且可以快速适应以应对新的挑战和未来的建模改进。

Conclusion:  MDBench 的引入为评估大型语言模型在多文档推理任务上的表现提供了一个重要的新工具，其合成生成过程展示了可控性和效率，有助于未来的研究和技术进步。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for diabetes prediction using structured numerical data. It compares six LLMs with three traditional machine learning models using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database. The results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, and one LLM outperforms traditional models in terms of F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using structured numerical data through zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods.

Method: Empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database to evaluate six LLMs (four open-source and two proprietary) and compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics.

Result: Proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B also outperforms traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Conclusion: LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks, but there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An interesting phenomenon is observed where reversible sentence embeddings can be generated to allow LLMs to reconstruct original text exactly without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of generating reversible sentence embeddings that enable LLMs to reconstruct original text exactly without altering model's weights.

Method: Introduce a special memory token whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly.

Result: Evaluated across English and Spanish datasets, sequences up to ~240 tokens, and model scales from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences.

Conclusion: This phenomenon highlights an interesting capability of LLMs with potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过自然语言处理技术，研究发现社会孤立和孤独感与自杀率的关系，并开发了高质量分类器以识别相关因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会孤立和孤独感近年来持续增加，并对自杀率有显著影响，因此需要有效的手段来监控和预防这些问题。

Method: 利用主题建模生成词汇表开发和监督学习分类器，分析美国国家暴力死亡报告系统中的文本数据。

Result: 识别出30万例自杀案例中有1,198例提到长期社会孤立，且男性、同性恋及离异人士更容易被归类为存在长期社会孤立。

Conclusion: 本方法可改进美国社会孤立和孤独感的监控和预防措施。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation. PrefBERT provides better feedback than traditional metrics and aligns well with the rewards needed for GRPO training. Human evaluations show that using PrefBERT improves policy model responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is difficult due to unclear distinctions between good and bad outputs, and existing methods often miss key aspects or are biased by pretraining data.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality. It offers better semantic reward feedback than ROUGE-L and BERTScore, supporting GRPO training effectively.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, confirm that PrefBERT remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with verifiable rewards GRPO needs.

Conclusion: Using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the unlearning of factual knowledge in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed, there's a need to remove specific pieces of knowledge for reasons like privacy and correcting harmful content.

Method: The authors empirically investigate the impact of learning-time knowledge encoding on unlearning effectiveness through experiments.

Result: Paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning performance but unlearning individual pieces of knowledge from text chunks is challenging.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding may be crucial for reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve dialogue discourse parsing, resolving ambiguities and outperforming SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linguistic features in dialogues like omission and idiom introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, making it challenging for parsers.

Method: The method involves two components: DCM which uses clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning, and CPO which optimizes clarifications by assessing contributions and providing feedback to enhance adaptability and alignment with parser requirements.

Result: Extensive experiments on STAC and Molweni datasets show that the approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DCM and CPO successfully address the challenges posed by ambiguities in dialogue discourse parsing and achieve superior performance.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CKD-EHR framework which uses knowledge distillation techniques to enhance disease risk prediction based on EHR. It fine-tunes Qwen2.5-7B as teacher model and transfers distilled knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model. On MIMIC-III dataset, it significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models have insufficient medical knowledge representation and low efficiency in clinical deployment for EHR-based disease prediction.

Method: CKD-EHR framework uses Qwen2.5-7B fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data as teacher model, generates interpretable soft labels through multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism, then transfers the distilled knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model.

Result: On MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR increases diagnostic accuracy by 9%, improves F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2 times inference speedup compared to baseline model.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR greatly improves resource utilization efficiency and enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将开放域对话生成分解为多响应生成和基于偏好的选择两个任务，并引入专门设计的数据集o2mDial，本研究提出的方法在较小的语言模型上应用时，能显著提高回复的多样性和质量，使其接近较大模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前的研究表明建模开放域对话的一对多特性可以提升回复多样性，但大多数现代基于大语言模型的对话系统并未明确这样做。

Method: 将开放域对话生成分为两个主要任务：多响应生成（MRG）和基于偏好的选择（PS）。首先生成一组语义和词汇上多样且高质量的回复，然后根据人类偏好选择一个回复。为此，创建了一个名为o2mDial的对话语料库，该语料库针对捕捉一对多特性进行了专门设计。利用o2mDial，提出了新的情境学习和指令调优策略以及针对MRG的新评估指标，还提出了一种基于模型的PS方法。

Result: 实证结果表明，在较小的大语言模型上应用所提出的两阶段框架进行开放域对话生成，可以在保持上下文连贯性的同时增强整体回复多样性，回复质量最多可提高90%。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，通过采用专门设计的语料库和策略，可以在较小的大语言模型上实现接近较大型模型性能的对话生成效果，特别是在提升回复多样性和质量方面。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Thunder-Tok, a Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility by 10% without sacrificing model performance through rule-based pre-tokenization and branching entropy-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient tokenizer for the Korean language that reduces token fertility without compromising model performance.

Method: Uses rule-based pre-tokenization method aligning with Korean linguistic structure and creates a seed vocabulary with tokens resembling linguistic units. Also employs a branching entropy-based selection algorithm to increase average token length.

Result: Reduces token fertility by approximately 10%, which is equivalent to reducing the number of tokens by 10% and improving inference speed by 10%, compared to BPE, without any drop in performance across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach of Thunder-Tok proves effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [14] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores memory in state-space language models, specifically the Mamba architecture, using primacy and recency effects. They observe a U-shaped accuracy profile and identify three mechanisms behind this pattern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models.

Method: Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture and analyzing the results through targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models.

Result: A consistent U-shaped accuracy profile was observed, with strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. Three mechanisms were identified: long-term memory supported by a sparse subset of channels; short-term memory governed by delta-modulated recurrence; and memory allocation modulated by semantic regularity.

Conclusion: The study uncovers key mechanisms of memory retention and forgetting in state-space language models, validated through experiments on large-scale Mamba-based models.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the application of various proprietary and open-source LLMs for single-label, multi-class text classification related to SDGs. It evaluates Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning techniques revealing that smaller models can perform comparably to larger ones with optimized prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tracking progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by leveraging text classification models and evaluating the effectiveness of different learning approaches with large language models.

Method: Analyze various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Evaluate task adaptation techniques such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning within this domain.

Result: Smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller models are effective alternatives to larger models in text classification tasks for SDGs, making efficient use of resources while maintaining performance.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning is a framework enhancing LLMs' reasoning ability via scalable and verifiable prototypes, improving performance across various reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind cross-domain generalization capabilities of Large Reasoning Models trained with Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning and hypothesize that shared abstract reasoning prototypes are responsible for this.

Method: Propose ProtoReasoning framework featuring an automated prototype construction pipeline, comprehensive verification system, and scalability within prototype space using Prolog and PDDL representations.

Result: ProtoReasoning achieves improvements over baseline models in logical reasoning (4.7%), planning tasks (6.3%), general reasoning (4.0%), and mathematics (1.0%). Ablation studies confirm enhanced generalization when learning in prototype space.

Conclusion: Reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models, validated by the success of the ProtoReasoning framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [17] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MinosEval, a new evaluation method for open-ended QA that distinguishes between factoid and non-factoid questions and uses different strategies to rank candidate answers. Experiments show it aligns better with human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for open-ended QA have limitations such as struggling to capture semantic similarities, lacking interpretability, failing to adapt across different question contents, and overlooking the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions.

Method: MinosEval first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies: an adaptive key-point scoring strategy for factoid questions and an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy for non-factoid questions.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets, including self-built ones, demonstrate that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and provides more interpretable results.

Conclusion: MinosEval is a novel and effective method for evaluating open-ended QA, offering improved alignment with human annotations and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates current language technologies' understanding of Basque and Spanish linguistic variations through Natural Language Inference (NLI), revealing a performance drop when dealing with these variations, especially in Basue. Encoder-only models show particular difficulty with Western Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties using Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task.

Method: Introduced a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish along with their variants. Conducted empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Performed error and ablation analyses.

Result: Showed a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, particularly in Basque. Found that the decline is due to linguistic variation itself rather than lexical overlap. Identified that encoder-only models struggle more with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Current language technologies face challenges in understanding linguistic variations, particularly peripheral dialects like Western Basque. Data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Conclusion: The Graph RAG framework provides a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a

knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of question answering systems over large-scale web corpora by enhancing answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness.

Method: TopClustRAG employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, K-Means clustering to group similar passages, and cluster-specific prompts for LLMs to generate answers which are then filtered, reranked, and synthesized.

Result: On the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation is effective in large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: To address the challenges in de-identifying court judgments, this paper proposes Thunder-DeID, a framework that includes constructing a Korean legal dataset, categorizing PII, and developing a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current de-identification process for court judgments is inadequate for handling large volumes while adhering to strict legal requirements. Legal definitions of personal identifiers are vague, making it hard to implement technical solutions.

Method: The authors propose Thunder-DeID which involves (i) constructing and releasing the first Korean legal dataset with annotated judgments, (ii) introducing a systematic categorization of PII, and (iii) developing an end-to-end DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID provides an effective solution for de-identifying court judgments while aligning with relevant laws and practices.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent advances in LLMs have improved general-domain NLP tasks, but their use in clinical trial recruitment is limited. This survey analyzes the task of trial-patient matching and discusses emerging LLM-based approaches, existing benchmarks, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the limitation of current LLM applications in critical domains like clinical trial recruitment. It aims to explore how LLMs can be utilized more effectively in matching trials with patients by leveraging their knowledge aggregation and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The method involves a comprehensive survey and analysis of the task of trial-patient matching within the context of clinical trial recruitment. The authors examine existing benchmarks, approaches, evaluation frameworks, and the challenges associated with adopting LLM technologies in clinical research.

Result: The result of this survey is a detailed contextualization of emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment, along with an assessment of current benchmarks and identification of challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing clinical trial recruitment through effective trial-patient matching while acknowledging the need for better benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to fully realize this potential.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

*Negar Foroutan,Jakhongir Saydaliev,Ye Eun Kim,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to improve language identification (LID) performance for low-resource languages on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages perform poorly in LID due to limited and single-domain data, which leads to class imbalance and bias issues.

Method: A novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach is proposed to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages.

Result: The SCL approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The proposed SCL approach demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing LID models for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are used in clinical decision support, but current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. The authors introduce DeVisE, a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current evaluation methods that fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns in LLMs used for clinical decision support.

Method: Construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV with both raw and template-based versions containing controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic and vital sign attributes. Evaluate five LLMs under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings by assessing input-level sensitivity and downstream reasoning.

Result: Zero-shot models show more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE can expose the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and inform the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SANSKRITI, a benchmark dataset with 21,853 question-answer pairs to evaluate language models' understanding of Indian cultural diversity across sixteen attributes. It assesses various language models, revealing disparities in handling culturally nuanced queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for language models to effectively understand local socio-cultural contexts beyond global effectiveness. India's rich cultural diversity requires specific evaluation.

Method: Developed SANSKRITI, a large dataset with question-answer pairs covering 28 states and 8 union territories across sixteen cultural attributes. Used it to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs).

Result: Significant disparities were found among the evaluated models in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, especially in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving cultural understanding in language models through its extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

TL;DR: The paper presents COSMMIC, a new dataset for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization in nine Indian languages. It includes 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 comments with ground-truth summaries. The study explores four configurations of summarization using text, comments, images or all combined, employing models like LLama3 and GPT-4 to identify the best setup for NLG tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for Indian languages and bridge gaps in Indian language resources.

Method: Creating the COSMMIC dataset with article-image-comment-summary quadruples in nine Indian languages; exploring four configurations for summarization (text alone, text+comments, text+images, text+comments+images); using state-of-the-art models for evaluation and IndicBERT for comment classification.

Result: COSMMIC is introduced as a unique resource integrating text, images, and user feedback for Indian languages. Experiments show that incorporating comments and images can enhance summarization quality, identifying supportive comments and filtering noise effectively.

Conclusion: COSMMIC provides a valuable resource for advancing NLP research in Indian languages by incorporating multimodal and multilingual aspects with user feedback, promoting inclusivity.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models often perform poorly in low-resource languages due to insufficient data. This paper presents Targeted Lexical Injection, a fine-tuning method that significantly enhances lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in a Swahili-centric LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of poor performance of Large Language Models in low-resource languages such as Swahili, caused by data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training.

Method: Introduce Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning approach using Low-Rank Adaptation and a contrastive learning objective to specifically target embeddings from an optimal early layer where strong lexical alignment is observed.

Result: TLI improves output-level lexical alignment for both trained and unseen Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity by about 28% in each case.

Conclusion: Targeted Lexical Injection enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent cross-lingual knowledge, providing an efficient strategy to improve lexical alignment in low-resource language-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions, but they frequently exhibit hallucinations. The authors propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types and introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), Context-Aware Cropping to better quantify model uncertainty and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that compromise reliability when interacting with operating systems through GUI agents.

Method: The method involves proposing a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, introducing the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) to evaluate the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction, and proposing Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed evaluation framework and methods effectively address the issue of hallucinations in MLLMs, providing deeper insights and improving the reliability of GUI agent interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

TL;DR: AgentGroupChat-V2是一种新型框架，通过分而治之的全并行架构、自适应协作引擎和代理组织优化策略解决当前多智能体系统在架构设计、跨域通用性和性能保证方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型的多智能体系统在社会模拟和复杂任务解决领域表现出巨大潜力，但在系统架构设计、跨域通用性和性能保证方面面临关键挑战，特别是在任务复杂度和智能体数量增加时。

Method: 提出了三个核心创新：1）分而治之的全并行架构，将用户查询分解为层次化任务森林结构；2）自适应协作引擎，根据任务特性动态选择异构LLM组合和交互模式；3）结合分而治之方法的代理组织优化策略以实现高效问题分解。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，AgentGroupChat-V2在多个领域的表现优异，如GSM8K准确率达到91.50%，AIME准确率达到30.4%，HumanEval的pass@1为79.20%。在高难度任务上优势更加明显，例如在Level 5 MATH问题上的改进超过11个百分点。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2为构建高效、通用的大语言模型多智能体系统提供了一个全面的解决方案，在复杂推理场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks, but it's unclear if this is due to true reasoning or statistical recall. This paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework that characterizes the hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs and generates problem variations to test these abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the high accuracy of LLMs on reasoning benchmarks is due to true reasoning capabilities or merely statistical recall of the training set.

Method: Introduced RE-IMAGINE, a framework that uses the ladder of causation's three levels (associations, interventions, and counterfactuals) to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs. It also includes an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy by altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation.

Result: Observed reductions in performance when several families of LLMs were queried with problem variations generated by RE-IMAGINE, indicating reliance on statistical recall for past performance.

Conclusion: The assessments open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理时常常需要补充外部知识以提供信息或减少幻觉。本文提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文前置到响应中，并仅在响应标记上计算损失来确保生成内容基于提供的外部上下文。实验表明，CINGS在文本和视觉领域都表现出更强的接地性，并且不会降低通用下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在推理时简单地附加上下文并不能确保生成内容基于提供的外部上下文，但我们需要模型能够根据提供的外部上下文生成响应。

Method: 提出了一种名为Context-INformed Grounding Supervision（CINGS）的后训练监督方法，其中模型在相关上下文前置到响应的情况下进行训练，同时仅在响应标记上计算损失并屏蔽上下文。

Result: 在文本领域，CINGS在11个信息检索数据集上优于其他训练方法，并且与推理时接地技术互补。在视觉-语言领域，用CINGS训练的模型替换视觉-语言模型的LLM主干可以减少四个基准测试中的幻觉，并在整个生成响应中保持事实一致性。

Conclusion: CINGS提高了模型在文本和视觉领域的接地能力，而不会降低通用下游性能。分析表明，CINGS通过改变模型的先验知识和行为，隐式地鼓励更多依赖外部上下文。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE is a new framework for single-pass, step-wise annotation that improves reasoning performance and efficiency in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process or step-wise supervision is vital for advancing multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs, but efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains challenging.

Method: SPARE aligns each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution with explicit reasoning for evaluation. It enables single-pass, per-step annotation.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance when used for fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup and training reward models for ranking/aggregating LLM-generated outputs. It achieves competitive performance on mathematical datasets while being 2.6 times more efficient than tree search-based automatic annotation.

Conclusion: SPARE offers a novel approach to process supervision that enhances both the quality and efficiency of annotations for LLMs.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [33] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for hyperbole and metaphor detection using bidirectional dynamic interaction. It outperforms baselines with a 28.1% F1 score increase for hyperbole and 23.1% for metaphor detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbole and metaphor detection is crucial in NLP but challenging due to semantic obscurity and expressive diversity. Current methods focus on superficial text features, ignoring associations between these devices and the role of implicit emotion.

Method: EmoBi consists of three modules: an emotion analysis module to mine connotations, a domain mapping module for identifying target and source domains, and a bidirectional dynamic interaction module for mutual promotion. A verification mechanism ensures accuracy and reliability.

Result: Experiments show EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods across four datasets, achieving significant F1 score improvements over the current SoTA.

Conclusion: EmoBi demonstrates effectiveness in advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection, offering potential for further improvements in this area.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 生成可靠响应对大语言模型（LLMs）来说是一个挑战。本文探讨了如何通过强化学习和内部推理增强LLM的接地能力，使用GRPO方法训练模型，并通过综合实验表明推理增强模型优于仅指令变体。分两阶段的训练设置进一步提高了接地效果。此外，通过GPT-4蒸馏重新审视指令微调，发现将其与GRPO结合可以提高长篇、生成式问答任务的性能。整体研究强调了推理、阶段性优化和结果驱动的强化学习的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于检索的生成（RAG）和基于引用的接地技术有潜力，但指令微调模型在简单场景中仍常失败，如遗漏明确答案、错误引用或在有证据时拒绝回答。因此需要探索强化学习和内部推理来增强LLM的接地能力。

Method: 使用GRPO方法训练模型，采用可验证的结果导向奖励机制，针对答案正确性、引用充分性和拒绝质量进行优化，而无需黄金推理轨迹或昂贵注释。分两个阶段进行训练：首先优化答案和引用行为，然后优化拒绝行为。同时通过GPT-4蒸馏重新审视指令微调，并将之与GRPO结合。

Result: 推理增强模型在ASQA、QAMPARI、ELI5和ExpertQA等数据集上的表现显著优于仅指令变体，特别是在处理无法回答的问题和生成良好引用的响应方面。分阶段训练设置稳定了学习信号并进一步提升了接地效果。结合GRPO和指令微调提高了长篇、生成式问答任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，推理、阶段性优化和结果驱动的强化学习对于构建更可验证和可靠的LLM具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [35] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种改进的局部-全局注意力模型，通过结合线性注意力机制处理窗口外信息，在短上下文场景中实现了性能和效率的更优权衡，尤其在512窗口大小时媲美全注意力模型，同时保持训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前局部-全局注意力模型在窗口大小选择上存在性能与效率的权衡问题，较小窗口虽提升效率但可能损害性能，因为局部注意力完全忽略窗口外的token。研究旨在解决这一内在局限性。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，将局部注意力与专门设计的线性注意力机制结合，用于捕捉窗口外token的信息。该方法通过预训练实验验证，并利用线性注意力的递归特性提升长上下文性能。

Result: RATTENTION在3B和12B规模的预训练中展现出更优的性能-效率权衡；512窗口大小时性能媲美全注意力模型；在RULER基准测试中表现出色，且未牺牲训练效率。

Conclusion: RATTENTION成功突破了局部-全局模型的Pareto权衡，实现短上下文场景中的效率提升，同时保持训练速度与现有最佳方法相当。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: Modern language models usually have open weights but closed training data. The researchers formalized the problem of data approximation from model weights, proposed several baselines and metrics, and developed a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus. This method is effective at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of approximating training data of modern language models from their open weights when the actual training data is not available.

Method: A gradient-based approach was developed to select the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus. This method uses only the weights of the original and fine-tuned models to recover useful data.

Result: The method significantly improved performance on the AG News classification task from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, it reduced perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Conclusion: The gradient-based approach can effectively approximate training data from model weights alone, even without any knowledge of the true training data, achieving close to original model performance.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Predictive Generation (PredGen) is a novel framework that can reduce the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-time voice chat applications by generating candidate responses while the user is still speaking, which can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output in real-time voice chat applications using LLMs.

Method: Propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a framework that uses speculative decoding at input time to generate candidate responses while the user is still speaking.

Result: Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that PredGen can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, with only minimal additional computation cost.

Conclusion: PredGen is a promising solution to mitigate or even eliminate the delay in real-time voice chat applications using LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new metric called Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) is introduced to evaluate gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), considering both binary and non-binary genders. GIFI assesses various aspects of model behavior related to gender inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of gender fairness in LLMs mainly focus on binary gender distinctions, lacking a comprehensive approach that considers non-binary genders as well.

Method: The authors developed GIFI, which includes a wide range of evaluations from simple probing with gender pronouns to testing different aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under various gender assumptions.

Result: Significant variations in gender inclusivity were found among 22 evaluated LLMs, indicating the need for improvement in this area.

Conclusion: Improving gender inclusivity in LLMs is crucial, and GIFI provides a benchmark for future research and development in enhancing gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Conclusion: Current open-source models have notable shortcomings in comprehending and reasoning within multimodal scientific literature; addressing these limitations is essential for advancing model capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate

fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal

TL;DR: 研究人员针对多句视觉描述的挑战，提出了新的任务Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing（DiscoSG）及相应数据集DiscoSG-DS，并开发了DiscoSG-Refiner模型。该模型通过两个阶段生成场景图，相比GPT-4有更快推理速度和较好性能提升，同时改善下游VLM任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析方法主要针对单句描述设计，在处理多句视觉描述时容易出现片段化图和跨句共指丢失等问题，影响下游Vision-Language Models (VLMs)任务性能。

Method: 提出新任务Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG) 和数据集DiscoSG-DS，包含多句描述与复杂场景图；引入DiscoSG-Refiner模型，利用小型PLM先生成基础图，再用另一PLM迭代优化图结构，降低全图生成开销。

Result: 在DiscoSG-DS上微调大型PLM（如GPT-4）可使SPICE指标提升约48%，但推理成本高且授权受限；DiscoSG-Refiner使用两Flan-T5-Base模型，仍使SPICE提升约30%，且推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，同时改善下游VLM任务表现。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner为高效生成复杂场景图提供了解决方案，显著提升了多句视觉描述解析性能和下游任务效果，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Method: Introduced WikiMixQA, a benchmark with 1,000 multiple-choice questions based on tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages. Evaluated 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models on this benchmark.

Result: Proprietary models achieved ~70% accuracy with direct context but performed significantly worse when retrieval from long documents was required. GPT-4-o was the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in the latter setting, while open-source models had a maximum accuracy of 27%.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the difficulties in long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as an important benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

TL;DR: 当前生成模型可以生成与人工编写的质量相当的多项选择题（MCQs），但在语义清晰度、可回答性和干扰项设计方面仍存在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多项选择题（MCQs）对学习和评估有价值，但手动创建具有不同难度水平和针对阅读技能的MCQs仍然是耗时且昂贵的任务。最近生成AI的进步为高效自动化MCQ生成提供了机会，但对生成MCQ的质量和可靠性评估关注有限，特别是在生成失败的情况。此外，大多数MCQ生成研究集中在英语上，其他语言尚未充分探索。

Method: 本研究调查了当前生成模型在为葡萄牙语阅读理解生成MCQs方面的能力。重点是生成与课程相关的叙述元素相符，并涵盖不同难度级别的MCQs。通过专家评审和分析从学生反应中提取的心理测量属性来评估这些MCQs，以评估其对小学生是否合适。

Result: 结果表明，当前模型可以生成与人工编写质量相当的MCQs。然而，确定了与语义清晰度和可回答性相关的问题。此外，在生成符合高质量MCQ选项设计标准并吸引学生的干扰项方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 虽然当前生成模型能够生成高质量的MCQs，但在语义清晰度、可回答性和干扰项设计方面仍需改进，以更好地适用于实际教学环境。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的后悔机制对于提高模型可靠性及揭示神经网络中认知编码方式至关重要。然而，当前存在缺少专门捕捉后悔表达的数据集、缺乏寻找最佳后悔表示层的指标以及缺乏识别和分析后悔神经元的指标等挑战。

Method: 1. 提出一种通过战略性设计提示场景构建全面后悔数据集的工作流程；2. 提出S-CDI指标以识别最佳后悔表示层；3. 提出RDS和GIC指标分别用于识别后悔神经元和分析激活模式。

Result: 成功使用S-CDI指标识别出最佳后悔表示层，显著提升了探测分类实验的性能。发现了模型层间的M型解耦模式，揭示了信息处理在耦合和解耦阶段的交替。通过RDS指标将神经元分为三类功能组：后悔神经元、非后悔神经元和双功能神经元。

Conclusion: 所提出的指标和方法为理解大型语言模型中的后悔机制提供了有效工具，有助于进一步提升模型可靠性和揭示神经网络中的认知编码方式。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores cross-cultural differences in interpretation of intensifiers among British and American English speakers through three experiments and a computational cognitive model. It finds that these differences stem from both literal meanings and weights on utterance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether cross-cultural communication differences arise from literal word meanings or pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: Conducted three experiments examining the interpretation of intensifiers such as 'quite' and 'very' by speakers of British and American English. Developed a computational cognitive model where listeners reason about speakers balancing informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation are due to both different literal meanings and different weights on utterance cost.

Conclusion: The findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, showing that cross-cultural interpretation differences result from an interplay between literal meaning and pragmatic factors.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [45] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks, LLMs can include all given concepts in sentences but may struggle to follow a specified concept order. This paper proposes Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to generate sentences adhering to a specific order. Analysis of 36 LLMs revealed biases towards certain concept orders, resulting in low-diversity outputs and highlighting the need for improvement in instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the evaluation of LLMs' abilities in both following instructions and generating diverse sentences with given concepts in a specified order, addressing shortcomings in current benchmarks that only focus on including all concepts without considering order.

Method: Propose Ordered CommonGen, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities by measuring ordered coverage, which assesses whether concepts are generated in the specified order.

Result: Analysis of 36 LLMs showed that while they generally understand instructions, they exhibit biases towards specific concept order patterns, leading to low-diversity outputs or identical results when the concept order changes. The best-performing model achieved only about 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: There is a need to enhance LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities, as demonstrated by the findings from the Ordered CommonGen benchmark.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在许多任务中表现出色，但在一致性和稳健推理方面仍存在困难。本文提出了基于群体的一致性学习（CC-Learn），这是一种强化学习框架，通过在从共享程序抽象中派生的相似问题组上进行训练，提高了LLM推理的可靠性。为了强制执行群体级别的连贯性，我们定义了一个结合群体准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚的综合目标，这是监督微调无法直接优化的。实验表明，CC-Learn在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中提升了准确性和推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在许多任务中表现出色，但它们在一致性和稳健推理方面仍然存在问题。因此，需要一种方法来提高LLM在处理类似问题时的推理一致性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn)的强化学习框架。该方法通过训练由共享程序抽象衍生的相似问题组（cohorts）来增强LLM推理的可靠性，并定义了一个综合目标函数，包括群体准确性、有效的分解问题的检索奖励以及对琐碎或无效查找的拒绝惩罚，以实现群体级别的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，在诸如ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提高了准确性和推理稳定性，超越了预训练和监督微调基线模型的表现。

Conclusion: 基于群体级别的强化学习（RL）可以有效地提升LLM的推理一致性，CC-Learn为这一领域提供了有力的支持和改进。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

### [48] [Leaky Thoughts: Large Reasoning Models Are Not Private Thinkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15674)
*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In this paper, we explore how reasoning traces of large models used as personal agents can leak privacy. Despite being considered internal and safe, these traces often contain sensitive data that can be extracted through prompt injections or accidental leaks. We find that test-time compute methods, especially increased reasoning steps, increase such leakage. Although these methods make models more cautious in final outputs, they also lead to more verbose reasoning which increases privacy risks. This highlights a tension between utility improvement through reasoning and the expansion of privacy attack surfaces. We advocate for safety measures to cover not just model outputs but also their internal reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked privacy risks associated with reasoning traces of large models functioning as personal agents, challenging the assumption that these traces are internal and therefore safe.

Method: The method involves probing and agentic evaluations to demonstrate how test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify privacy leakage. It explores the balance between making models more cautious in final answers and the side effect of increasing verbosity in reasoning which leads to more leakage.

Result: The result shows that while increasing test-time compute budgets improves caution in final model outputs, it simultaneously amplifies privacy leakage through more verbose reasoning processes.

Conclusion: We conclude that there is a fundamental trade-off between enhancing model utility through reasoning and expanding the privacy attack surface. Safety measures should extend beyond just regulating model outputs to include safeguarding the internal reasoning processes.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Method: 评估21个机器翻译系统在三种不同难度翻译方向上的性别中立反应，并对实际观察到的具体性别中立策略进行分类和讨论，同时考察二元性别刻板印象对性别中立翻译的影响。

Result: 大多数机器翻译系统未能提供性别中立翻译，但在某些目标语言下，有少数系统能够切换至性别中立翻译并使用特定策略。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，当前机器翻译系统在应对性别模糊时普遍缺乏性别中立翻译能力，需要进一步改进以更好地处理性别中立问题。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

TL;DR: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. To address this challenge, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs.

Motivation: Deploying large VLMs in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their substantial computational demands. There is a need for a general-purpose distillation framework that can be applied to different types of VLMs.

Method: The paper introduces GenRecal, which incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs.

Result: Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Conclusion: GenRecal is a successful framework for distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts, overcoming the challenge posed by the diversity of VLM architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能够有效检测来自未见过的、私有调整的大型语言模型的文本，解决了现有检测器在面对此类文本时性能下降的问题。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores

Method: ViLLa integrates three components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their locations, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer applying logic-based inference to answer those queries.

Result: ViLLa successfully grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to accurately answer questions related to count, presence, and location of animals in images.

Conclusion: ViLLa demonstrates the ability to connect visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries, offering modularity and transparency unlike end-to-end black-box models.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GraphGSOcc model for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, which solves two issues of existing methods through Dual Gaussians Graph Attention and Multi-scale Graph Attention framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by addressing limitations in current 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods regarding feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities.

Method: Proposes the GraphGSOcc model that integrates semantic and geometric graph Transformer. Introduces Dual Gaussians Graph Attention to dynamically construct dual graph structures for better feature aggregation and encoding semantic relationships. Uses Multi-scale Graph Attention framework for optimizing boundary details and modeling object-level topology.

Result: On the SurroundOcc dataset, achieves an mIoU of 24.10%, reduces GPU memory usage to 6.1 GB, showing a 1.97% improvement in mIoU and 13.7% reduction in memory compared to GaussianWorld.

Conclusion: The GraphGSOcc model effectively addresses the limitations of previous 3DGS methods, providing improved performance and reduced memory consumption in 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

TL;DR: 随着AI生成视频在媒体平台上的普及，区分合成内容和真实片段变得至关重要。本文介绍了一个新数据集DAVID-X和模型DAVID-XR1，能够提供细粒度的证据来识别AI生成的视频，并将检测过程从黑箱转变为透明可验证的诊断流程。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法将AI生成视频检测从不透明的黑箱决策转变为透明且可验证的诊断过程，为构建值得信赖的AI生成内容识别系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD is a novel framework that improves DETR-based monocular 3D detection through three contributions: Mask Separated Self-Attention for stable matching, Variational Query Denoising to prevent gradient vanishing, and a self-distillation strategy for query quality improvement. It performs well on KITTI benchmark and generalizes effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-like architectures have limitations when directly applied to monocular 3D detection from a single image, which hinders their optimal performance.

Method: The proposed method MonoVQD includes: 1) Mask Separated Self-Attention to integrate denoising into DETR architecture and stabilize Hungarian matching; 2) Variational Query Denoising to solve the gradient vanishing problem in denoising process by introducing stochastic properties; 3) A self-distillation strategy using insights from later decoder layers to improve earlier layer queries.

Result: MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Its core components also enhance performance in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: MonoVQD fundamentally advances DETR-based monocular 3D detection with its innovative mechanisms and demonstrates robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化指令的迭代精炼方法ChartIR，以提升多模态大模型在图表转代码生成任务中的表现。通过区分视觉理解和代码翻译两个任务，并将其分解为初始代码生成和迭代精炼两个阶段，该方法在Qwen2-VL和GPT-4o模型上均表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大模型在各种视觉任务中取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但在图表转代码生成任务上的表现仍有待提高。此任务需要模型不仅具备精确的视觉理解能力，还要能准确地将视觉元素转化为结构化代码。直接提示模型执行这一复杂任务往往无法得到满意结果。

Method: 首先区分了视觉理解和代码翻译两个任务，并设计了描述和差异两种类型的结构化指令来完成视觉理解部分。描述指令捕捉参考图表的视觉元素，而差异指令则刻画参考图表与生成图表之间的差异。这些指令将视觉特征转换为语言表示，从而促进后续的代码翻译过程。其次，将整体图表生成流程分为初始代码生成和迭代精炼两个阶段，实现最终输出的逐步优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，与其它方法相比，所提出的方法在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上都取得了更优的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的ChartIR方法能够有效提升多模态大模型在图表转代码生成任务上的表现，通过结构化指令和迭代精炼策略，实现了从视觉理解到代码翻译的有效转化。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PictSure, an ICL framework that focuses on the role of image embeddings in few-shot image classification. It outperforms existing models on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building effective image classification models is challenging in data-scarce domains due to the impracticality of collecting large labeled datasets. In-context learning shows promise for few-shot image classification but lacks focus on the role of image embeddings.

Method: Presents PictSure, a framework that systematically examines the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream few-shot image classification performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that training success and out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how embedding models are pretrained. PictSure outperforms existing models on out-of-domain benchmarks while performing comparably on in-domain tasks.

Conclusion: PictSure highlights the importance of image embeddings in in-context learning for few-shot image classification and provides insights into optimizing embedding model pretraining.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size determination in CNNs. It balances information gain, efficiency, and accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional models with uniform 3x3 kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size selection in CNNs impacts receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy, yet it is often overlooked. Current approaches typically use a fixed heuristic (e.g., uniform 3x3 kernels), which may not be optimal for all layers or applications.

Method: The Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF) integrates principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to determine optimal, layer-wise kernel sizes. It aims to balance information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, GTSRB) show that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1% accuracy improvement and 42.8% reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models. Real-world case studies in medical image classification and traffic sign recognition further validate the approach.

Conclusion: Kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for efficient and application-aware CNN designs, suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: A deep learning-based approach automates key-frame identification in retail videos, providing automatic annotations of products and customers, saving costs and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate video annotation is crucial for modern retail applications but conventional methods are time-consuming and costly due to manual labeling.

Method: The method uses deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments to automate key-frame identification and annotation.

Result: The approach achieves accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling, leads to an average of 2 times cost savings, and allows human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames without reducing annotation quality.

Conclusion: This automation significantly reduces operational costs and saves time and effort in retail video labeling tasks, making it valuable for various retail applications.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的主动视角选择（AVS）方法，通过神经不确定性地图来提高3D重建效率和准确性。该方法使用UPNet预测不确定性地图，从而选择最有信息量的视角进行3D神经渲染模型训练，显著减少计算开销并保持重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D重建方法在选择最佳视角时通常依赖于计算每个候选视角的不确定性，这种方法计算成本高且效率较低。因此，需要一种更高效、准确的方法来进行主动视角选择（AVS）。

Method: 引入了名为UPNet的轻量级前馈深度神经网络，通过输入单张3D物体图像输出预测的不确定性地图。利用从大量自然物体中观察到的启发式规则，UPNet学习从视角外观到潜在体积表示不确定性的直接映射。接着，将所有之前预测的神经不确定性地图聚合，抑制冗余候选视角，并选择最具信息量的视角。最后，基于这些选中的视角训练3D神经渲染模型并评估其性能。

Result: 尽管使用的视角数量仅为上限的一半，但该方法仍能达到与现有方法相当的重建精度。此外，在AVS过程中显著减少了计算开销，速度提升了400倍，并且CPU、RAM和GPU使用减少了50%以上。重要的是，该方法无需额外训练即可有效推广到包含新物体类别的AVS任务。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AVS方法通过UPNet预测不确定性地图实现了高效的视角选择，不仅显著降低了计算成本，还保持了较高的3D重建精度。此方法在处理新物体类别时表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

TL;DR: The paper presents DPO-Kernels for T2I models with Hybrid Loss, Kernelized Representations, and Divergence Selection to enhance alignment. It introduces DETONATE, a benchmark assessing social bias, and AQI, a measure of safe/unsafe image separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment of text-to-image models ensuring generated images capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.

Method: DPO-Kernels for T2I models include Hybrid Loss integrating embedding-based objectives, Kernelized Representations using various kernels, and Divergence Selection expanding beyond KL regularizer. The paper also introduces DETONATE benchmark and AQI measure.

Result: Empirical results show strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR).

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds and DETONATE along with complete code is publicly released.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PeRL, a reinforcement learning approach for multimodal tasks, with strategies to enhance exploration-exploitation trade-off. It outperforms baselines in multi-image benchmarks while maintaining single-image task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches are limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts and struggle with more complex scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning.

Method: PeRL is proposed along with a multi-stage strategy that enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This includes permutation of image sequences for diversity and a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling.

Result: Experiments show that the PeRL trained model surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines significantly on multi-image benchmarks and maintains comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: PeRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-image benchmarks and shows promise in handling complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在医学图像扩散模型上提出了一种频率校准的重建误差(FCRE)方法，用于成员推断攻击(MIA)，通过聚焦中频范围的重建误差来提高隐私风险评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MIA方法在医学图像上的应用面临挑战，因为重建误差受图像固有难度影响，且扩散模型难以重建高频细节。

Method: 提出FCRE方法，专注于特定中频范围的重建误差，排除高频和低频区域的影响。分析逆扩散过程，获取中频重建误差，并计算重构图像与原始图像之间的结构相似性指数得分，以该得分与阈值比较确定成员身份。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，所提出的FCRE方法优于现有的MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法通过减少图像固有难度的干扰因素，在医学图像扩散模型的MIA中表现出更优性能，为隐私风险评估提供了改进方案。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for distinguishing between quark and gluon jets using calorimeter images from simulated CMS Open Data. It finds that ViT-based models, particularly hybrids like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt, outperform traditional CNNs in various performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is crucial for new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider.

Conclusion: This work establishes a systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, providing a valuable resource for further deep learning research in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

### [72] [Hyper-Local Deformable Transformers for Text Spotting on Historical Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15010)
*Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps with a novel hyper-local sampling module and SynthMap+, a method to generate synthetic map images. Experiments show that PALETTE outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of effective methods and training data. Previous approaches are tailored to specific map styles and recent machine learning-based text spotters have challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component in a text instance.

Method: PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. It also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. Additionally, SynthMap+ is proposed to automatically generate synthetic map images for training text spotters.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. It has been deployed to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels.

Conclusion: PALETTE is an effective end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps with a wide variety, and SynthMap+ is a novel approach to generate synthetic map images for training text spotters.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces StyleWallfacer, a novel framework for style transfer that unifies training and inference processes. It includes semantic-based style injection, human feedback-driven data augmentation, and a triple diffusion process without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in traditional style transfer methods and unify the framework for different tasks, aiming to enable artist-level style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Method: 1) Semantic-based style injection using BLIP and large language models to create a semantic gap for efficient style knowledge injection; 2) Data augmentation strategy based on human feedback to reduce overfitting; 3) Training-free triple diffusion process manipulating self-attention layers for style injection while preserving text control.

Result: Achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization with artist-level results, preserved original image content, and enabled image color editing during style transfer for the first time.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer successfully addresses limitations of traditional style transfer methods, offering a unified framework for various tasks with superior performance.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issues of training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization methods used in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve vector quantization by solving training instability and codebook collapse issues that arise due to mismatch between feature and code vector distributions.

Method: The method involves using Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, enhancing codebook utilization and reducing quantization error.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces quantization error, with both empirical and theoretical support.

Conclusion: Employing Wasserstein distance for distribution alignment in vector quantization effectively resolves training instability and codebook collapse problems.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs like SAM, which improves the quality of negative prompts using a Confidence Map Synergy Module combining DINOv2 and SAM. It selects point prompts with top-k pixels as positive points and uses Gaussian distribution for negative points followed by K-means clustering, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods based on Large Vision Models (LVMs) cannot effectively utilize negative prompts, resulting in poor performance on low-contrast medical images.

Method: Propose SynPo, a method that includes: designing a Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining DINOv2 and SAM to select point prompts; selecting top-k pixels as positive points set; choosing negative points set using a Gaussian distribution; performing independent K-means clustering for both sets; leveraging these selected points as high-quality prompts for SAM to obtain segmentation results.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: SynPo addresses the issue of ineffective negative prompts in existing training-free methods based on LVMs, significantly improving performance on low-contrast medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Motivation: 现有的点云分析方法在聚合局部结构时存在无关点干扰和特征层次差距的问题，而直接基于几何结构编码的增强方法又面临高计算开销和噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 提出了Point Distribution Set Abstraction (PDSA) 模块，利用高维空间中的相关性来纠正特征分布，同时引入轻量级的跨阶段结构描述符以区分点的相关性，并通过减少邻居特征矩阵的方差和增加类别可分性来增强结构同质性。此外，引入了关键点机制以优化计算开销。

Conclusion: PDSA模块提高了点云分析的计算效率和鲁棒性，并在不同基线模型上验证了其泛化能力，为点云处理提供了更高效、更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and
training weight is available at: https://github.com/AGENT9717/PointDistribution

*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), a new task that combines corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding to locate objects described by sentences in large image collections. A benchmark, metric, and zero-shot baseline are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for visual search engines only solve one part of the dual problem - either visual grounding or text-to-image retrieval. There is a need for a system that can both identify relevant images and precisely localize the object within them.

Method: The method involves introducing ReSeDis, which unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, it decides if an object is in an image and provides its location through bounding boxes or segmentation masks. The paper also presents a curated benchmark and a task-specific metric.

Result: A straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model was provided, showing significant potential for future improvements. The results indicate that ReSeDis offers a realistic testbed for developing robust multimodal search systems.

Conclusion: ReSeDis represents a step towards building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems by combining retrieval and localization tasks into one unified framework.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Method: Training generalist models for retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL) with a few examples provided at inference time and proposing a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT.

Result: Extensive evaluation of a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets established a first baseline, highlighting both the potential and limitations of in-context learning for OCT.

Conclusion: The authors have explored VICL for retinal OCT, created an evaluation protocol, identified strengths and limitations through extensive testing, and contributed to future research by releasing their code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT

Conclusion: Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC)方法可以有效保护用户隐私，防止VLP模型的利用，同时保持图像压缩功能和感知质量，且易于集成到现有Learned Image Compression (LIC)模型中。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) is proposed to address limitations in existing multimodal medical image fusion methods, enhancing feature capture and cross-modal interaction. It integrates a diffusion process, UNet, fusion modules, and a hybrid loss function, yielding high-quality fused images with balanced brightness, color, contrast, and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features and insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, resulting in suboptimal fused image quality.

Method: The study proposes DM-FNet, which consists of two stages: Stage I uses a diffusion process to train UNet for image reconstruction, capturing detailed information through progressive denoising. Stage II inputs noisy images into the fusion network, integrating three key fusion modules for adaptive processing of different modalities. A hybrid loss function harmonizes brightness, color, contrast, and detail in the fused image.

Result: Experimental results across various medical image types show exceptional performance in objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges.

Conclusion: DM-FNet effectively addresses the limitations of existing MMIF methods by enhancing feature capture and cross-modal interaction, producing high-quality fused images.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore

enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale

TL;DR: RA-NeRF is a novel method that can predict highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories, achieving state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks rely heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Current approaches fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex.

Method: The proposed RA-NeRF method uses an incremental pipeline to reconstruct the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, it employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate noise for pose estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on the Tanks&Temple dataset and the NeRFBuster dataset show that RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RetroMem的回忆增强型伪装物体检测架构，通过整合历史知识动态调整伪装模式感知和推理，采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），显著提升了模型在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的伪装物体检测方法主要基于静态视觉表示建模，缺乏明确的机制来获取历史上下文信息，这限制了它们在处理挑战性伪装场景时的适应性和效果。

Method: RetroMem采用了两阶段训练范式：1) 学习阶段：设计了一个密集多尺度适配器（DMA），以极少的可训练参数增强了预训练编码器捕捉丰富多尺度视觉信息的能力；2) 回忆阶段：提出了动态记忆机制（DMM）和推理模式重建（IPR），利用学习到的知识与当前样本上下文之间的潜在关系，重建伪装模式的推理。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的数据集上的大量实验表明，RetroMem显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过整合历史知识和动态调整伪装模式感知与推理，有效提高了模型在复杂伪装场景中的表现。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To address the challenges of time-to-market and quality in the semiconductor sector, leveraging DA techniques can minimize manual re-labeling and re-training of models, thus reducing computational costs and allowing experts to focus on high-value tasks.

Method: The DBACS approach, inspired by CycleGAN and enhanced with additional loss terms, was developed and tested in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings using real-world Electron Microscope images.

Result: The DBACS approach was successfully validated on real-world Electron Microscope images, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

Conclusion: Domain Adaptation techniques, particularly the proposed DBACS approach, show promise in improving robustness and scalability in the semiconductor industry, reducing costs and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world

Motivation: 现有的INR方法难以有效表示细节丰富和快速变化的视频内容，主要由于内部网络特征利用不足以及网络设计缺乏视频特定考虑。

Method: 提出了一种多尺度特征融合框架MSNeRV，包括：1）在编码阶段使用时间窗口增强时间一致性；2）将视频分为多个GoPs并在GoP级别使用网格表示背景；3）设计多尺度空间解码器和尺度自适应损失函数以整合多分辨率和多频率信息；4）引入多尺度特征块以改进特征提取。

Result: 实验结果表明，MSNeRV在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上表现出优越的表示能力和更高的压缩效率，特别是在动态场景下超越了VTM-23.7（随机访问）。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合显著提高了INR方法的视频表示能力，并在动态场景中实现了更高效的视频压缩。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Conclusion: BCRNet significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented

significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the

Motivation: 现有的个体再识别方法难以应对由于身体运动和姿势变化引起的动物皮毛或皮肤图案的几何扭曲问题。

Method: 提出了一种几何感知的纹理映射方法，使用表面法线估计来引导展开过程，同时保留3D表面和2D纹理空间之间的几何一致性。并将此模式保持的UV映射与现有的再识别技术相结合。

Result: 实验表明，在不同的姿态和视角下，该方法提高了再识别的准确性，最高可提升5.4%。

Conclusion: 所提出的几何感知纹理映射方法能够在不依赖真实UV注释的情况下，通过自监督学习有效提高个体再识别的准确性。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

*Yujin Kim,Hyunsoo Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDIS, a new method for Data-Free Image Synthesis which uses a text-to-image diffusion model to improve synthetic image quality. It incorporates Domain Alignment Guidance and Class Alignment Token for better alignment with training data distribution, showing superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) methods suffer from generating samples that do not accurately reflect the training data distribution due to lack of prior knowledge about natural images.

Method: DDIS leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as an image prior to generate high-quality synthetic images. It introduces Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) to align synthetic data domain with the training data domain during diffusion sampling and optimizes a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to capture class-specific attributes.

Result: Experiments on PACS and ImageNet datasets show that DDIS outperforms previous DFIS methods by generating samples that more accurately reflect the training data distribution, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in data-free applications.

Conclusion: DDIS is a novel and effective approach for Data-Free Image Synthesis, producing higher quality synthetic images that better align with the training data distribution.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

### [96] [NERO: Explainable Out-of-Distribution Detection with Neuron-level Relevance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15404)
*Anju Chhetri,Jari Korhonen,Prashnna Gyawali,Binod Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In the field of deep learning, especially in medical imaging, ensuring reliability is crucial. Identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a key indicator of model reliability. The paper proposes a new OOD scoring method called NERO, which uses neuron-level relevance at the feature layer to improve OOD detection and achieve better performance than current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing OOD detection methods that may not fully capture OOD diversity, thus improving model reliability in medical imaging.

Method: The proposed method, NERO, clusters neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution class to form representative centroids. It introduces a relevance distance metric to measure deviation from these centroids and enhances OOD separability. Additionally, it incorporates scaled relevance in the bias term and combines feature norms to refine performance.

Result: Validated across multiple deep learning architectures on the Kvasir and GastroVision benchmarks, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Conclusion: NERO provides an effective framework for OOD detection in medical imaging, offering enhanced reliability and explainability.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

*Shujia Li,Haiyu Zhang,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yutong Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents GenHOI, a two-stage framework for 4D human-object interaction synthesis that generalizes to unseen objects and generates high-quality sequences. It uses Object-AnchorNet for keyframe reconstruction and Contact-Aware Diffusion Model for interpolation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of synthesizing 4D human-object interactions (HOI) by overcoming the limitation of large-scale 4D HOI datasets, focusing on generalization to unseen objects and high-fidelity sequence generation.

Method: The method involves a two-stage framework called GenHOI. In the first stage, an Object-AnchorNet reconstructs sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects using only 3D HOI datasets. In the second stage, a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) interpolates these keyframes into dense 4D HOI sequences. Within ContactDM, a novel Contact-Aware Encoder extracts human-object contact patterns and Contact-Aware HOI Attention integrates these signals into the diffusion model.

Result: The experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on the OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, indicating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects and high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: GenHOI successfully achieves generalization to unseen objects and high-fidelity 4D HOI sequence synthesis, demonstrating its effectiveness through state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Motivation: The limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models for myocardial scar segmentation from LGE cardiac MRI.

Method: Introduce CLAIM framework containing SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE) to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. Also, employ a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator.

Conclusion: CLAIM enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar

we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet is a new framework for dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar which eliminates the need for dense LiDAR supervision by leveraging sparse LiDAR and refined radar measurements, achieving superior performance with only about 1% supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to eliminate the requirement of dense LiDAR supervision in depth estimation from millimeter-wave radar, making the process less costly and data-intensive.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors, which serve as anchors to guide monocular depth prediction without needing dense supervision. This method uses sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements.

Result: RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. It reduces RMSE by 35.30% on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and by 34.89% in real-world deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: RaCalNet successfully achieves dense metric depth estimation with only about 1% supervision density compared to dense-supervised methods, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型虽然无需特定数据训练就能实现复杂场景的精确控制，但存在定位不精确和不真实伪影的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为WinWinLay的无需训练的方法，包含两个核心策略：非局部注意力能量函数和自适应更新。前者通过重新分配注意力分数来减少空间分布偏差，使对象更好地符合布局指令；后者基于Langevin动力学引入自适应更新方案，以促进域内更新并尊重布局约束。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，WinWinLay在控制元素放置和实现照片级视觉保真度方面表现出色，优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay方法通过改进的策略提升了布局到图像生成任务中的精度和现实主义，无需额外训练即可超越现有技术。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

*Junhao Wu,Aboagye-Ntow Stephen,Chuyuan Wang,Gang Chen,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for ultra-high spatial resolution land cover classification imagery at 0.3 m resolution, incorporating SAM2 knowledge and FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance detail modeling while keeping lightweight design, achieving better results with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-high spatial resolution land cover classification is crucial but challenging due to high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Current methods focus on lower resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, which limits their applicability for higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision.

Method: A parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery was developed. This framework leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter, enhancing fine-grained detail modeling with only 5.96% of total model parameters.

Result: The method effectively uses unlabeled data and maintains minimal parameter overhead, delivering robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency. It achieves a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses challenges in ultra-high spatial resolution land cover classification by providing a lightweight solution that enhances detail modeling and delivers improved performance.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

### [106] [A Unified Graph-based Framework for Scalable 3D Tree Reconstruction and Non-Destructive Biomass Estimation from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15577)
*Di Wang,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel unified framework for end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline to estimate forest above-ground biomass (AGB) non-destructively. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Current Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) methods face limitations in scalability and practical deployment due to reliance on high-quality point cloud data and multiple pre-processing steps.

Method: The study proposes a unified framework enabling end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds through a graph-based pipeline. This approach integrates tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction via dedicated graph operations such as pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning.

Result: The method showed strong performance under challenging conditions, including leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). It provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation.

Conclusion: This advancement improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation by reducing dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishing ULS as a viable alternative to TLS, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [107] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DLoRAL是一种新的方法，通过双阶段训练（C-LoRA和D-LoRA）结合稳定扩散模型，实现视频超分辨率中细节丰富与时间连贯性的平衡。实验表明，该方法在准确性和速度上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于稳定扩散的现实视频超分辨率方法在保持时间一致性的同时往往牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不理想。因此，需要一种能有效提取低质量输入视频中的退化鲁棒时间一致性先验，并增强视频细节的方法。

Method: 提出了一种双LoRA学习（DLoRAL）范式，包含两个模块：跨帧检索（CFR）模块用于聚合帧间互补信息；一致性LoRA（C-LoRA）用于从降质输入中学习鲁棒的时间表示。之后固定CFR和C-LoRA模块，训练细节LoRA（D-LoRA）以增强空间细节并保持时间一致性。这两个阶段交替迭代优化，最终将两个LoRA分支合并到稳定扩散模型中，实现高效高质量的单步视频恢复。

Result: 实验结果表明，DLoRAL在准确性和速度方面都表现出强大的性能，能够提供一致且细节丰富的输出。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过有效的双阶段训练策略，在视频超分辨率任务中实现了时间和空间维度上的良好平衡，提升了视觉质量和处理效率。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

### [108] [Mono-Modalizing Extremely Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15596)
*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架M2M-Reg，用于多模态可变形图像配准（DIR），通过仅使用单模态相似性进行训练，解决了高度异构模态之间的配准问题。实验表明，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准上比现有方法高出两倍的DSC指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于功能成像模式（如PET和FA）与结构参考（如MRI、CT）之间的极端异质性，传统的无监督DIR方法难以学习可靠的映射并经常扭曲图像。这是因为指导这些模型的相似性度量无法捕捉高度不同的模态之间的对齐。

Method: 提出了M2M-Reg（Multi-to-Mono Registration），一种新的框架，利用仅单模态相似性来训练多模态DIR模型，同时保留了现有的架构范式。还引入了GradCyCon正则化器，利用M2M-Reg的循环训练方案促进微分同胚。此外，该框架可以自然扩展到半监督设置中，整合预对齐和未对齐的对，而不需要地面真值变换或分割掩码。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中达到了比先前方法高两倍的DSC指标，证明了其在处理高度异构多模态DIR中的有效性。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg框架提供了一种有效的解决方案，用于处理高度异构模态之间的多模态可变形图像配准，具有更高的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MICV-yonsei/M2M-Reg.

*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Zhirui Gao,Jiazhao Zhang,Yihan Cao,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建的在线框架，用于高效的3D物体检测，结合Cubify Anything和CLIP模型，并通过关联和优化模块处理多视角数据，在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D物体检测方法依赖密集点云重建，导致计算开销大、内存限制严重，难以实现实时部署。

Method: 利用流式RGB-D视频输入，采用Cubify Anything作为预训练视觉基础模型进行单视图3D物体检测，结合CLIP捕捉开放词汇表语义；使用关联模块（含3D NMS和匹配模块）和优化模块（基于粒子滤波的IoU引导随机优化技术）融合多视角检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在在线方法中达到最先进的性能，具有良好的泛化能力，可实现实时感知，即使在超过1000平方米的环境中也是如此。

Conclusion: 所提出的无需重建的3D物体检测框架在保持低计算复杂度的同时，实现了高效、实时的3D物体检测，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

### [110] [HOIDiNi: Human-Object Interaction through Diffusion Noise Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15625)
*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). It uses Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) to optimize in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model, separating the process into an object-centric phase and a human-centric phase. This approach ensures precise hand-object contact while maintaining motion naturalness. Evaluations on the GRAB dataset show HOIDiNi outperforms prior works in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating human-object interactions trade off between realism and physical correctness. The authors aim to create a system that achieves both simultaneously.

Method: The method, HOIDiNi, utilizes Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) to directly optimize in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model. The process is separated into two phases: an object-centric phase for making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines full-body motion based on these choices.

Result: HOIDiNi demonstrates superior performance in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality compared to prior works and baselines, as evaluated quantitatively, qualitatively, and subjectively on the GRAB dataset. It can generate complex, controllable interactions such as grasping, placing, and full-body coordination using only textual prompts.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi successfully synthesizes realistic and physically correct human-object interactions by optimizing in the noise space of a diffusion model and employing a structured two-phase approach.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

### [111] [FindingDory: A Benchmark to Evaluate Memory in Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15635)
*Karmesh Yadav,Yusuf Ali,Gunshi Gupta,Yarin Gal,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了评估长期记忆在实体任务中的应用，本文提出了一个新的基准测试，并结合最先进的视觉-语言模型和低级别的导航策略进行了一系列实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型视觉-语言模型（VLMs）难以处理长时间跨度的任务，特别是在需要整合多日经验的实体场景中。现有的长视频问答基准未能充分涵盖实体挑战，例如物体操作和导航。因此，需要一个新基准来专门评估涉及长期记忆的任务表现。

Method: 作者引入了一个新的基准测试，用于在Habitat模拟器中评估长期实体任务。该基准包括60个任务，可程序化扩展为更长、更具挑战性的版本。此外，还提供了将最先进的VLMs与低级别导航策略相结合的基线方法，以评估这些模型在记忆密集型任务中的表现。

Result: 通过使用提出的基准和基线方法，研究揭示了现有VLMs在长期记忆任务中的局限性，并指出了改进的方向。

Conclusion: 新基准测试能够有效评估VLMs在长期实体任务中的表现，强调了整合记忆和推理的重要性。未来的研究应致力于提升模型处理大规模图像集合和执行基于历史信息的动作的能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

### [112] [Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645)
*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，输入图像的视觉质量对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的表现有复杂影响，有时低质量图像反而能提高模型性能。为此，提出了一种名为VQ-TTT的方法，通过调整输入图像以适应模型特定任务的偏好，从而提升MLLMs在各种数据集上的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对于输入图像质量如何影响MLLMs的表现知之甚少，尤其是高感知质量的图像是否一定能带来更好的模型理解尚未明确。因此，需要系统地研究视觉质量与MLLMs表现之间的关系，并探索如何优化输入图像以匹配模型偏好。

Method: 通过在一系列领先的MLLMs和多种视觉-语言基准测试中应用受控退化和风格转变，揭示了视觉质量悖论。为解决这一问题，提出了Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)，该方法包括：1) 在冻结的视觉编码器前插入一个可学习的低秩核以调节频率内容；2) 通过LoRA仅微调视觉编码器的浅层。此方法能在单次前向传播中动态调整输入图像，使其与特定任务的模型偏好对齐。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了在所有评估的MLLMs和数据集上的平均准确率，且无需外部模型、缓存特征或额外训练数据。这表明，适应性而非普遍“清洁”的图像更符合AI作为主要数据客户的需求。

Conclusion: 高质量的视觉输入并不一定等同于MLLMs更好的理解，模型表现可能因图像偏离人类感知的保真度而改善。未来应关注适应性图像处理方法，以更好地满足AI系统的独特需求。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

*Ankan Deria,Adinath Madhavrao Dukre,Feilong Tang,Sara Atito,Sudipta Roy,Muhammad Awais,Muhammad Haris Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ViMaR, a two-stage inference framework that enhances efficiency and output fidelity in vision-language models by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. It achieves significant improvements in caption quality and speedup compared to existing methods, demonstrates robust cross-model guidance, and shows potential for self-improving VLM pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for inference-time search in vision-language models are computationally expensive and prone to low-confidence generations leading to persistent hallucinations.

Method: ViMaR uses a two-stage inference framework: (1) identifying the highest-value caption among diverse candidates in a single pass; (2) selectively refining overlooked or weakly grounded segments. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness.

Result: ViMaR generates captions significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, achieving over 4x speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. It generalizes effectively to guide decoding in stronger unseen models and leads to consistent improvements in caption quality across different models.

Conclusion: ViMaR is a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy with flexibility and modularity. It has potential for self-improving vision-language model pipelines through self-training.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的联合估计和合成方法显著提升了重光照任务的质量和适用范围，为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Motivation: Existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training due to their limitations such as limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and lack of annotations about exploration and the world.

Method: Introduced Sekai, a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations including location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories.

Conclusion: Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

<details>

Motivation: Diffusion-based image generation models produce high-quality synthetic content but have slow and computationally expensive inference. Existing caching methods often rely on rigid heuristics that limit acceleration or generalization.

Method: Proposed ECAD employs a genetic algorithm to learn efficient, per-model caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier using a small set of calibration prompts. It requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images and adapts to different diffusion models.

Result: ECAD identifies schedules that outperform previous state-of-the-art methods, improving COCO FID by 4.47 while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x on PixArt-alpha. Consistent improvements are demonstrated across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: ECAD is established as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference, offering significant speedups and fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available
